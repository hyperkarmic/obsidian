# useReducer()
UseReducer: The `useReducer` hook accepts two arguments: the reducer and an initial state. From the hook, you can get an array which contains the current state for the reducer as well as a dispatch function which allows you to update the state. Because the dispatch function is always available, you don't have to use a `useEffect` hook to call it like you do with `useState`.

# useContext()
UseContext: I will mention another hook called `useContext`, but this will not be [a comprehensive post on React context](https://www.iamtimsmith.com/blog/how-to-use-react-context). I will simply show you how to use the hook in the event that you need to. First, what is Context? Along with hooks, the team behind React added a feature which allowed for global state management and called it Context. By using this tool, you can keep items in state outside of a specific component and use it where needed.

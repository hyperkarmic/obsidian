## What is a React Hook?

A hook is a special function that lets youÂ **"hook into"**Â various React features. Imagine a function that returns an array with two values:

-   **The first value:**Â a variable with the state.
-   **The second value:**Â a variable with an handler (a function to change the current state).

That's it, easy-peasy. ðŸ¥ž

# React Hooks Definitions:
### Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features. Because of this, class components are generally no longer needed.
<hr>

## Hooks allow us to "hook" into React features such as state and lifecycle methods.
<hr>
## u must `import` Hooks from `react`.
<hr>

## React Hooks are in-built functions that allow React developers to use state and lifecycle methods inside functional components, they also work together with existing code, so they can easily be adopted into a codebase.
<hr>

## Hooks are simply functions that allow you to **hook into** or **make use of** React features.
<hr>
## This essentially means that Hooks are functions that 'hook' into [React state](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2021/09/how-to-use-state-in-react-example.html) and [lifecycle features](https://www.java67.com/2021/09/ow-to-use-lifecycle-methods-in-functinal.html) from inside the function components.
<hr>
**Hooks apply the React philosophy (explicit data flow and composition) _inside_ a component, rather than just _between_ the components.**
<hr>
Hooks solve exactly that problem. Hooks let you use React features (like state) from a function — by doing a single function call. React provides a few built-in Hooks exposing the “building blocks” of React: state, lifecycle, and context.
<hr>
I believe that Hooks are a bridge to Redux but also a way of managing simple state without introducing Redux.
<hr>

With the introduction of [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), you’ll get to use a state and manage the class-based lifecycle logic inside of the function components.
<hr>
[React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) (introduced in React since version 16.8) are JavaScript functions that allow us to build our React component ONLY with a function component.
<hr>
Previously, React features such as state and lifecycle functions are available only for class-based components. Function-based components are referred to as dumb, skinny, or just presentational components because they can’t have access to state and lifecycle functions.

But since the release of React Hooks, function-based components have been elevated into first-class citizens of React. It has enabled function components to compose, reuse, and share React code in new ways.
<hr>
They allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. They are a powerful way to write stateful components, and they are a great way to write functional components.

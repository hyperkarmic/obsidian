# useEffect
UseEffect: The second most used hook is likely the `useEffect` hook which gives us access to a lifecycle method. In a class component, there are a handful of lifecycle methods you can use to make things happen at various points during the component's "lifecycle". Among the most commonly used were `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate` which would allow you to do something after the component had loaded and rendered.

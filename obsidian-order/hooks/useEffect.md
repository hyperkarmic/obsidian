# useEffect
UseEffect: The second most used hook is likely the `useEffect` hook which gives us access to a lifecycle method. In a class component, there are a handful of lifecycle methods you can use to make things happen at various points during the component's "lifecycle". Among the most commonly used were `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate` which would allow you to do something after the component had loaded and rendered.

# What Is UseEffect

**useEffect** is a hook that allows you to perform side effects from a functional component. It serves the same purpose as **componentDidMount**, **componentDidUpdate**, and **componentWillUnmount** lifecycle methods in React classes, but is unified into a single API.

useEffect takes two params.

1.  **A function**
2.  **An array of dependencies (optional)**

Example.

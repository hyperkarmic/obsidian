session storage is similar to local storage, but the data stored in session storage is only available for the duration of the current browsing session. Once the user closes the browser, the data is deleted.

Both local storage and session storage are useful for storing data that you want to access and use on multiple pages of a website, without having to send a request to the server to retrieve it each time. They can be used to store small amounts of data, such as user preferences or form field values, and can improve the performance and user experience of a website by reducing the number of requests made to the server.

local storage and session storage are properties of the Window object in JavaScript, which means they are part of the web API. They are not objects that you need to create or declare yourself.

Session storage is a useful tool for storing data in the browser that is only needed for the duration of the current browsing session. Here are a few examples of use cases for session storage:

-   Storing temporary data: Session storage can be used to store data that is only needed for the duration of the current browsing session and does not need to be persisted beyond that. This can be useful for storing temporary data, such as the contents of a shopping cart or the state of a form, that can be discarded when the user closes the browser.
-   Storing data for a multi-page form: Session storage can be used to store data from a multi-page form, so that it is available as the user moves from page to page. This can be particularly useful for forms with a large number of fields, or forms that take a long time to fill out.
-   Storing data for a single-page application: Session storage can be used to store data in a single-page application, so that it is available as the user interacts with the application. This can be useful for storing data such as the state of the application or the user’s progress through a series of tasks.
-   Improving performance: Session storage can be used to store data that is used frequently on a website, so that it can be accessed without sending a request to the server each time. This can improve the performance of the website by reducing the number of requests that need to be made.
-   Storing data for a wizard-style form: Session storage can be used to store data from a wizard-style form, which is a form that is broken up into multiple steps or pages. This can be useful for forms with a large number of fields, or forms that take a long time to fill out.
-   Storing data for a survey: Session storage can be used to store data from a survey, so that the user’s progress through the survey is not lost if they navigate away from the page or close the browser.
-   Storing data for a quiz: Session storage can be used to store data from a quiz, such as the user’s answers and score, so that it is available as they move from question to question.
-   Storing data for a game: Session storage can be used to store data from a game, such as the current level or score, so that it is available as the user plays the game.#

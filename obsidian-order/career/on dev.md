While this may not be readily obvious to the inexperienced developer , being a good programmer is not the same as being a good developer. In order to have greater clarity on this point , it would be prudent to understand the differences between a developer and a programmer. A programmer is simply a person who is capable of writing computer programs to solve a problem , while a developer is a programmer that implements or develops a system as per given requirements.

## Knowledge is not the same as skill.

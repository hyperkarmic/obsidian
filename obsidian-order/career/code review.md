_“Code review decreases defects by 40%. The cost of doing code review is around 2%.” — “Code reviews enhance software quality. Baker Jr, Richard A.”_

Poor code review can happen if the following occurs.

-   tight deadlines
-   rush before the sprint ends
-   showing off how fast one can code

Some are valid reasons to rush. Although most forget what code reviews bring to the table. You can learn from others, share knowledge, and save time on future development.

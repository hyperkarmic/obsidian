## Track Each Position You Apply For

Here’s where things can get especially messy. Applying for multiple positions at once leaves you with a lot of different things to manage. It’s _very_ important to make sure you’re keeping track of all of the different details as you go along.

One of the best ways to do this is to create a system for keeping track of each position you apply for. One of the most common ways of doing this is to create a spreadsheet. This is an easy and effective way to help you keep track. Don’t worry about making anything too fancy. Just be sure to include basic information such as:

-   Company Name: this is the name of the organization you’re applying to
-   Contact Details: include the name, email, and phone number of your contact at the company. In most cases, this will be a hiring manager
-   Date Applied: the date you submitted your initial application
-   Deadlines and Interviews: deadlines for upcoming information the company asks for and scheduled interviews
-   Date Followed Up: date you followed up after an application submission or interview
-   Status of Application: whether you’ve been rejected, are waiting to hear back, or have an interview scheduled

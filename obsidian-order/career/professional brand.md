# Professional Brand

###### Why does your professional brand matter as a woman in tech?

What is your professional brand? Your professional brand is a combination of your skill set, competence, and how you are perceived. Being self aware and intentional about your brand matters for everyone in the tech industry. However, it often carries more weight for women in tech who face the additional challenges of working under stereotypes, biases, and leadership gaps. Traditional gender expectations, confidence gap, and other [challenges that women technologists must overcome](https://www.cio.com/article/3610668/7-challenges-women-face-in-getting-ahead-in-it.html) all influence the elements of their brand-building.

### 1. Get a better understanding of how you’re perceived
### 2. Analyze that feedback in comparison with your self-image ie _Hello,  i’m  *your name* I’m a *your title* at *your company*. I consider myself *brand1*

### 3. Make a plan of action relevant to your career goals

### 4. Consider the non-verbal side of your professional brand


### 5. Be patient and compassionate on your professional branding journey

### 6. Focus on your strengths -- they’ll help keep imposter syndrome at bay
### 7. Establish trust -- with yourself and others

*As you build relationships, who you know plays an important role. Be sure to connect with others as human beings. It goes a long way in establishing or re-establishing your brand.*

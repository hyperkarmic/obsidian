Explanation of the code:

This code represents a basic implementation of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture in a Node.js application that uses Express.js as the web framework and MySQL as the database management system. The goal is to create a simple app that allows users to interact with a database of cats.

The `package.json` file contains information about the project, its dependencies and scripts. The dependencies include Express.js, Express Handlebars (exphbs), and the MySQL library.

The `server.js` file is the entry point of the application. It imports the required modules, including `express`, `express-handlebars`, and `catsController.js`. It creates an instance of the `express` application and sets the view engine to `handlebars`. It also defines a static directory for serving static assets (e.g., CSS, images) and sets up middleware to parse incoming requests with JSON payloads. Lastly, it starts the server and listens on a specified port.

The `config` folder contains three modules: `utils.js`, `orm.js`, and `connection.js`. `utils.js` contains utility functions that help construct SQL queries. `orm.js` contains functions that map to basic SQL CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. `connection.js` establishes a connection with the MySQL database.

The `controllers` folder contains the `catsController.js` module. This module defines routes for handling GET and POST requests. The GET request retrieves all the cats from the database and renders them to the `index.handlebars` view. The POST request creates a new cat in the database and sends back the ID of the new cat.

The `models` folder contains the `cat.js` module. This module defines a class `Cat` that maps to the `cats` table in the database. It contains methods that call the ORM functions defined in `orm.js`.

The `db` folder contains two SQL scripts: `schema.sql` and `seeds.sql`. `schema.sql` creates the database schema and `cats` table. `seeds.sql` contains sample data for populating the `cats` table.

The `public` folder contains two subfolders: `js` and `css`. `cats.js` contains client-side JavaScript code that handles the form submission and updates the page dynamically. `styles.css` contains styles for the HTML templates.

The `views` folder contains three files: `index.handlebars`, `main.handlebars`, and `cats.handlebars`. `index.handlebars` is the main view that displays all the cats. `main.handlebars` is the layout file that wraps around all the views. `cats.handlebars` is a partial view that displays an individual cat.

Learning outcomes:

By completing this exercise, a developer should be able to:

-   Understand the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and how it can be used to organize code in a Node.js application.
-   Understand how to establish a connection to a MySQL database and perform basic CRUD operations using an ORM.
-   Understand how to use Handlebars templates to render dynamic content on the server-side.
-   Understand how to use client-side JavaScript to handle form submission and update the page dynamically.
***
This is a server-side application written in Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL that follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.

The `package.json` file defines the application's metadata and dependencies, including Express.js, Handlebars, and MySQL. The `start` script is defined to run the server.

The `server.js` file sets up the Express application and specifies the routes. It serves static files in the "public" directory, uses middleware to parse request bodies, and sets up Handlebars as the view engine. The server listens on the specified port, and a console message confirms that the server is running.

The `config` folder contains the utility functions and the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) code that interacts with the MySQL database. The `util.js` file contains functions that help construct SQL statements for creating, updating, and selecting data. The `orm.js` file contains the main ORM code that uses the MySQL connection to perform database operations. The `connection.js` file sets up the MySQL connection using the `mysql` library.

The `controllers` folder contains the `catsController.js` file, which defines the routes and their corresponding callback functions. The callback functions call the ORM methods to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the MySQL database.

The `models` folder contains the `cat.js` file, which defines the `Cat` model. The `Cat` model is a JavaScript class that defines the properties and methods for a cat object. The `Cat` model uses the ORM methods to interact with the MySQL database.

The `db` folder contains the `schema.sql` and `seeds.sql` files, which define the database schema and the initial data to populate the database.

The `public` folder contains the client-side JavaScript and CSS files that the server serves to the client. The `js` folder contains the `cats.js` file, which contains the client-side JavaScript code that makes AJAX requests to the server to fetch and create data. The `css` folder contains the `styles.css` file, which defines the styles for the HTML templates.

The `views` folder contains the Handlebars templates that the server renders and serves to the client. The `layouts` folder contains the `main.handlebars` file, which defines the HTML skeleton that the other templates extend. The `partials` folder contains the `cats.handlebars` file, which defines the HTML for rendering the list of cats.

To understand callbacks, it is essential to know that callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and executed when the other function finishes its execution. This application uses callbacks to handle asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from the MySQL database.

In this application, the ORM methods, such as `all()`, `create()`, and `update()`, take a callback function as an argument that is called when the MySQL query is complete. The callback function receives the query result as an argument and handles the response. For example, in the `catsController.js` file, the `/` route handler uses the `all()` method to fetch all the cats from the database. The `all()` method takes a callback function that receives the array of cat objects and renders the `index` template with the `cats` data.

```javascript
router.get("/", (req, res) => {
  const onData = (data) => {
    const response = {
      cats: data,
    };
    console.log(response);
    res.render("index", response);
  };
  cat.all(onData);
});

```

The client-side JavaScript code in the `cats.js` file uses callback functions to handle the AJAX requests' responses. For example, the `$.post()` method takes a callback function that is executed

The code is meant to create a simple web application that allows users to perform CRUD operations on quotes stored in a MySQL database. The application has two pages. The first page displays all the quotes in the database and allows users to create a new quote or delete an existing quote. The second page shows the details of a single quote and allows users to update it.

The `package.json` file defines the project's dependencies, including Express, Express-Handlebars, and MySQL.

`js/server.js` sets up an Express app that handles data parsing, serves static files, sets up Handlebars as the view engine, and establishes a connection to the MySQL database. It also defines the routes that the application will handle:

-   The root route serves the `index.handlebars` template populated with all quote data.
-   A route with a parameterized URL serves the `single-quote.handlebars` template populated with data that corresponds to the ID in the route URL.
-   A `POST` request to `/api/quotes` creates a new quote using data posted from the front-end.
-   A `DELETE` request to `/api/quotes/:id` deletes a quote based on the ID in the route URL.
-   A `PUT` request to `/api/quotes/:id` updates a quote.

`quotes/quotes.js` defines the front-end behavior for the application. It uses jQuery to send `POST`, `DELETE`, and `PUT` requests to the server when the user interacts with the UI. It also reloads the page to display the updated list of quotes.

Learning outcomes:

-   Setting up an Express app with Handlebars and MySQL
-   Defining routes for an Express app
-   Handling `GET`, `POST`, `DELETE`, and `PUT` requests with Express
-   Using jQuery to send AJAX requests from the front-end to the server
-   Using Handlebars templates to generate dynamic HTML
-   Connecting to a MySQL database from a Node.js application
-   Performing CRUD operations on a MySQL database from a Node.js application.
***
This exercise involves the development of a simple web application using Express, MySQL, and Handlebars. The application allows users to create, read, update, and delete popular quotes. The application consists of two pages; the first page displays all quotes in the database, while the second page allows the user to update the selected quote. The server is built using Express, with Handlebars serving as the template engine. The MySQL database is accessed using the MySQL Node.js module. The required endpoints for the application include creating a new quote, deleting an existing quote, and updating an existing quote. The data is persisted in a MySQL database.

Key files:

1.  package.json - defines the metadata and dependencies for the application.
2.  js/server.js - implements the server and required endpoints.
3.  quotes/quotes.js - implements the client-side JavaScript for handling user events.

Learning outcomes:

1.  Building an HTTP server with Express and handling HTTP requests
2.  Using Handlebars as the template engine for rendering HTML pages
3.  Connecting to a MySQL database with Node.js and the mysql module
4.  Performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a MySQL database using Node.js
5.  Handling events on the client-side with jQuery and Ajax.
***
This is a simple web application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete popular quotes. The application has two pages. The first page shows all of the quotes within a database and allows users to create a new quote or delete an existing one. A button next to each quote, labeled "Update This Quote," will take users to the other page that shows the quote selected and allows them to update it with new information. The server is built using Node.js, Express, and Handlebars for the templating engine. The data is stored in a MySQL database, and the ORM used is the native MySQL driver. The application is served in a single page layout, with dynamic HTML elements being updated via AJAX requests.

-   A `package.json` file is present, and it contains information about the dependencies used in the project, including Express, Express-Handlebars, and MySQL.
    
-   A `js` directory containing a `server.js` file, which sets up the Express app, defines the routes, and connects to the MySQL database.
    
-   A `quotes` directory contains `quotes.js`, which defines the client-side functionality of the application. This includes handling the form submissions, updating the HTML content using Handlebars, and making AJAX requests to the server to retrieve or update data.
    
-   A `views` directory containing the template files, including `index.handlebars`, `single-quote.handlebars`, and `layouts/main.handlebars`. The `index.handlebars` file is the main view for the application, while the `single-quote.handlebars` file is used to display a single quote. The `layouts/main.handlebars` file is used to define the overall layout of the application.
    
-   A `public` directory containing the static assets, including the CSS file and the client-side JavaScript file.
    

Key code snippets:

1.  Setting up the Express app and the connection to the MySQL database.

```javascript
var express = require("express");
var exphbs = require("express-handlebars");
var mysql = require("mysql");

var app = express();

// Sets up the Express app to handle data parsing
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use(express.json());

app.use(express.static("public"));

app.engine("handlebars", exphbs({ defaultLayout: "main" }));
app.set("view engine", "handlebars");

var connection = mysql.createConnection({
  host: "localhost",
  port: 3306,
  user: "root",
  password: "",
  database: "quotes_db"
});

connection.connect(function(err) {
  if (err) {
    console.error("error connecting: " + err.stack);
    return;
  }
  console.log("connected as id " + connection.threadId);
});

```

2.  Defining the routes for the server, including handling GET and POST requests.
```javascript
// Serve index.handlebars to the root route, populated with all quote data.
app.get("/", function(req, res) {

});

// Serve single-quote.handlebars, populated with data that corresponds to the ID in the route URL.
app.get("/:id", function(req, res) {

});

// Create a new quote using the data posted from the front-end.
app.post("/api/quotes", function(req, res) {

});

// Delete a quote based off of the ID in the route URL.
app.delete("/api/quotes/:id", function(req, res) {

});

// Update a quote.
app.put("/api/quotes/:id", function(req, res) {

});

```

3.  Handling form submissions and making AJAX requests to the server.

```javascript
$(".delquote").on("click", function(event) {
  var id = $(this).data("id");

  // Send the DELETE request.
  $.ajax("/

```

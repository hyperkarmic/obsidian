This code exercise is a simple example of how to use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library with a MySQL database. The ORM is responsible for creating a bridge between the database and the code, allowing for easy data manipulation using high-level programming concepts instead of SQL queries. The code is composed of a server.js file that requires the ORM functions and uses them to perform database operations. There is also a connection.js file that sets up the MySQL connection, and an orm.js file that exports the ORM functions. The code also includes a schema.sql file that sets up the database schema and a seeds.sql file that populates the database with some sample data.

Learning Outcomes:

-   Understanding of what an ORM is and how it can be used to interact with a database using high-level programming concepts
-   Knowledge of how to set up a MySQL connection in Node.js using the mysql package
-   Ability to write basic SQL queries to create and populate a database schema
-   Understanding of how to use an ORM library to perform basic database operations like selecting, inserting, updating and deleting data

Code Explanation:

-   package.json: This file specifies the dependencies of the project, in this case, only the mysql package is required.
-   server.js: This file requires the orm.js file, which exports the ORM functions. Then, it calls the selectAndOrder, selectWhere and findWhoHasMost functions to perform some database operations.
-   config/connection.js: This file sets up the MySQL connection by creating a connection object using the mysql package and passing in the database options. It also connects to the database and logs a message to the console when the connection is successful.
-   config/orm.js: This file exports three functions: selectWhere, selectAndOrder, and findWhoHasMost. These functions use the connection object from the connection.js file to perform SQL queries and return the results.
-   db/seeds.sql: This file contains some sample data that can be used to populate the database.
-   db/schema.sql: This file contains the SQL queries to create the database schema, which consists of two tables: buyers and pets.

Code Snippets:

1.  Connecting to the database in connection.js:

```javascript
const connection = mysql.createConnection(dbOptions);

const onConnect = (err) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log("Successfully connected to the DB");
};

connection.connect(onConnect);

module.exports = connection;

```

This code creates a connection object using the mysql package and the database options specified in the dbOptions object. It also defines a callback function to log a message to the console when the connection is successful. Finally, it exports the connection object so that it can be used in other parts of the code.

2.  Selecting data from the database in orm.js:

```javascript
const selectWhere = (table, column, value) => {
  const query = `SELECT * FROM ${table} WHERE ${column}="${value}"`;
  const onQuery = (err, rows) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(rows);
  };
  connection.query(query, onQuery);
};

```

This code defines the selectWhere function, which takes three arguments: the name of the table to select from, the name of the column to filter on, and the value to filter on. It then creates an SQL query using string interpolation and the specified arguments. Finally, it uses the connection object to execute the query and return the results in the onQuery callback function.

3.  Using the ORM functions in server.js:

```javascript
const orm = require("./config/orm.js");

orm.selectAndOrder("animal_name", "pets", "price");
orm.selectWhere("pets", "animal_name", "Rachel");
orm.findWhoHasMost("buyer_name

```

***
This code is an example of using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to interact with a MySQL database. The code consists of a server.js file that requires the orm.js file located in the config folder. The ORM uses the connection.js file, also located in the config folder, to establish a connection to the MySQL database. The orm.js file contains three functions: `selectWhere`, `selectAndOrder`, and `findWhoHasMost`.

The `selectWhere` function takes in a table name, column name, and value and returns all the rows in the table where the specified column has the specified value. The `selectAndOrder` function takes in a column name, a table name, and a column name to order by and returns all the rows in the table ordered by the specified column in descending order. The `findWhoHasMost` function takes in four arguments: a column name from table one, a foreign key column name from table two, the name of table one, and the name of table two. This function returns the name and the count of the table one column with the most corresponding rows in table two.

The `connection.js` file establishes a connection to the MySQL database using the `mysql` package and exports the connection. The `schema.sql` file creates a database named `pets_db` with two tables, `buyers` and `pets`. The `buyers` table has an `id` and a `buyer_name` column, while the `pets` table has an `id`, `animal_breed`, `animal_name`, `price`, and a `buyer_id` column. The `buyer_id` column in the `pets` table is a foreign key that references the `id` column in the `buyers` table. The `seeds.sql` file inserts data into the `buyers` and `pets` tables.

To run this code, you will need to have MySQL installed and create a database named `pets_db`. Then, run the `schema.sql` and `seeds.sql` files to create the tables and insert data. Finally, run the `server.js` file using node to execute the ORM functions.

Here is an example code snippet to run the `selectAndOrder` function:

```javascript
const orm = require("./config/orm.js");

orm.selectAndOrder("animal_name", "pets", "price");

```

This will output all the rows in the `pets` table ordered by the `price` column in descending order.

The learning outcome of this exercise is to understand how to use an ORM to interact with a database. The ORM simplifies the code required to interact with the database by providing an object-oriented interface to the database. The ORM handles the low-level database operations, such as querying and updating the database, and abstracts them away from the developer, allowing them to focus on the application logic.

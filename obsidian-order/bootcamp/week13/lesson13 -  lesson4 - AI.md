This is a simple Node.js/Express.js web application that uses Handlebars.js as the templating engine to render dynamic content.

The `package.json` file contains information about the project, including its name, version, and dependencies.

The `server.js` file sets up an Express.js app and defines three routes. The first two routes respond to requests for weekday and weekend lunches and render the `index.handlebars` view using the corresponding data object. The third route responds to requests for all lunches and renders the `all-lunches.handlebars` view using an object that contains an array of lunch objects and the name of the person eating them.

The `views/index.handlebars` file defines a simple template that renders a lunch object's lunch property as an H1 element.

The `views/all-lunches.handlebars` file is a more complex template that defines an HTML skeleton and renders the body content as a Handlebars partial.

Finally, the `layouts/views/main.handlebars` file is the main layout file used by Handlebars to render views. It defines an HTML skeleton and includes the body content as a Handlebars partial.

Learning outcomes from this code:

-   How to use Express.js to define routes and serve content.
-   How to use Handlebars.js as the templating engine to render dynamic content.
-   How to use Handlebars partials to reuse HTML code across multiple templates.
-   How to use a layout file to define an HTML skeleton that is shared by multiple templates.

***
This is a simple web application built with Node.js and Express, using Handlebars as the templating engine. The purpose of the application is to display lunch options. The application has three routes:

1.  `/weekday`: This route renders the `index` view with data from the `lunches` array at index 0.
2.  `/weekend`: This route renders the `index` view with data from the `lunches` array at index 1.
3.  `/lunches`: This route renders the `all-lunches` view with data from the `lunches` array and the `eater` variable set to "david".

The application uses `express-handlebars` as the template engine, which is set up in the `server.js` file. The `views` directory contains two Handlebars files: `index.handlebars` and `all-lunches.handlebars`, and there is a subdirectory called `layouts` that contains the `main.handlebars` file. The `main.handlebars` file is the layout file that is used as the default layout for all views, as specified in the `server.js` file.

When a route is accessed, the `res.render()` method is used to render a view with the specified data. The first argument to `res.render()` is the name of the view file to render (without the file extension), and the second argument is an object containing the data to be passed to the view.

The `index.handlebars` view displays a lunch option, as specified by the `{{lunch}}` Handlebars expression. The `all-lunches.handlebars` view simply includes a `{{{ body }}}` expression, which will be replaced with the content of the view being rendered. The `main.handlebars` layout file is used to wrap the content of the other views, and includes the basic structure of an HTML document.

The `package.json` file contains the dependencies for the application, which are `express` and `express-handlebars`.

To run the application, you can use the following command in the terminal:

```javascript
npm install
node server.js

```

Once the server is running, you can access the application in your web browser by navigating to `http://localhost:8080/weekday`, `http://localhost:8080/weekend`, or `http://localhost:8080/lunches`. The application will display lunch options depending on the route accessed.

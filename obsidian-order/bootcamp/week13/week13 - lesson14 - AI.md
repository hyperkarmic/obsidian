This codebase includes a Node.js server that connects to a MySQL database and uses Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) to retrieve data from it. Specifically, the `server.js` file contains a call to the `selectWhere` method in the `orm.js` file, passing in the name of a table, a column to search, a value to search for, and a callback function to execute once the query completes. The `orm.js` file defines the `selectWhere` method, which constructs a MySQL query string, passes it to the MySQL connection object in `connection.js`, and executes the query. Once the query completes, the results are passed to the callback function that was passed in from `server.js`.

The `schema.sql` file defines the schema for the MySQL database, creating two tables: `clients` and `parties`. The `seeds.sql` file contains some example data to populate these tables.

Learning Outcomes:

By studying this codebase, a developer can learn the following:

-   How to connect to a MySQL database using Node.js
-   How to define an ORM that maps database tables to JavaScript objects
-   How to construct MySQL queries using template literals and pass them to the MySQL connection object
-   How to execute MySQL queries and handle the results using callbacks
-   How to define foreign key constraints in a MySQL schema

Key Code Snippets:

1.  Connecting to the MySQL database in `connection.js`:
```javascript
var connection = mysql.createConnection({
  host: "localhost",
  port: 3306,
  user: "root",
  password: "",
  database: "parties_db"
});

connection.connect(function(err) {
  if (err) {
    console.error("error connecting: " + err.stack);
    return;
  }
  console.log("connected as id " + connection.threadId);
});

```

This code defines a MySQL connection object using the `mysql` module, passing in the connection details for the database. It then calls the `connect` method on the connection object, passing in a callback function to execute once the connection is established. If there is an error, the callback logs an error message to the console.

2.  Defining the `selectWhere` method in `orm.js`:

```javascript
var orm = {
  selectWhere: function(tableInput, colToSearch, valOfCol, cb) {
    var queryString = "SELECT * FROM ?? WHERE ?? = ?";
    connection.query(queryString, [tableInput, colToSearch, valOfCol], function(err, result) {
      if (err) throw err;
      cb(result);
    });
  }
};

```

This code defines an object called `orm` with a method called `selectWhere`, which takes four arguments: the name of a table, a column to search, a value to search for, and a callback function. Inside the method, a MySQL query string is constructed using template literals, and then passed to the MySQL connection object using the `query` method. The method also passes an array of values to replace the placeholders in the query string. Once the query completes, the results are passed to the callback function that was passed in as an argument.

3.  Calling the `selectWhere` method in `server.js`:

```javascript
var orm = require("./config/orm.js");

orm.selectWhere("parties", "party_type", "grown-up", function(result) {
  var data = result;
  console.log(data);
});

```

This code requires the `orm.js` file, and then calls the `selectWhere` method on the `orm` object, passing in the name of the `parties` table, the name of the `party_type` column, the value `
***
This is a simple Node.js project with a MySQL database that demonstrates how to use Object Relational Mapping (ORM) to interact with the database.

The `server.js` file requires the `orm.js` file from the `config` folder and calls the `selectWhere` method on it, passing in arguments for table name, column name, column value and a callback function. The callback function logs the result to the console.

The `orm.js` file contains the `selectWhere` method that takes in four arguments: the table name, column name, column value and a callback function. The method generates a SQL query string and uses the `connection.query` method to execute the query, passing in the query string and an array of values. If there is an error, it is thrown. Otherwise, the callback function is called with the result.

The `connection.js` file creates a MySQL connection to the local database with a host, port, user, password and database name. If there is an error connecting to the database, an error message is logged. Otherwise, a success message is logged along with the connection thread ID.

The `schema.sql` file contains SQL commands to create a database named `parties_db`, create two tables named `clients` and `parties`, and set up a foreign key relationship between them.

The `seeds.sql` file contains SQL commands to insert data into the `clients` and `parties` tables.

To run this project, one needs to run the `schema.sql` and `seeds.sql` files to create the database and populate it with data. Then, running the `server.js` file will call the `selectWhere` method on the `parties` table and log the result to the console.

The main learning outcomes from this project include:

-   Understanding how to use ORM to interact with databases in Node.js
-   Understanding how to set up a MySQL connection in Node.js
-   Understanding how to use SQL commands to create tables, set up relationships and insert data
-   Understanding how to use callback functions to handle database query results in Node.js.

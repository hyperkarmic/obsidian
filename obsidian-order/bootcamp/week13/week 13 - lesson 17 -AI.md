The given code is a basic MVC (Model-View-Controller) structure for a web application that allows users to manage and view a list of cats. The application uses Node.js, Express.js, Handlebars.js, and MySQL as the backend database. The code includes the following files:

1.  `readme.md`: Contains instructions on how to add a delete button to the index page and update the files to include the functionality.
2.  `package.json`: Contains metadata and dependencies for the application.
3.  `server.js`: Sets up the server and handles routing.
4.  `config/connection.js`: Contains the database connection settings and an ORM (Object Relational Mapping) for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database.
5.  `config/orm.js`: Contains the ORM for performing CRUD operations on the database.
6.  `controllers/catsController.js`: Contains the controllers for handling HTTP requests and responses.
7.  `db/schema.sql`: Contains the SQL code for creating the database schema.
8.  `db/seeds.sql`: Contains the SQL code for inserting sample data into the database.
9.  `models/cat.js`: Contains the model for handling data manipulation on the cats table in the database.
10.  `public/js/cats.js`: Contains the client-side JavaScript code for handling HTTP requests and responses.
11.  `public/css/styles.css`: Contains the styling rules for the web page.
12.  `views/index.handlebars`: Contains the HTML and Handlebars code for rendering the index page.
13.  `views/layouts/main.handlebars`: Contains the HTML and Handlebars code for the main layout of the web page.
14.  `views/partials/cat-block.handlebars`: Contains the HTML and Handlebars code for rendering each cat block on the index page.

The learning outcomes of this code exercise are:

1.  Understanding the basic structure of a web application using the MVC pattern.
2.  Learning how to use Node.js, Express.js, Handlebars.js, and MySQL to build web applications.
3.  Learning how to handle HTTP requests and responses in the controllers.
4.  Learning how to perform CRUD operations on the database using an ORM.
5.  Learning how to use client-side JavaScript to make HTTP requests and handle responses.

Here are some key code snippets for understanding the exercise:

`server.js`:

```javascript
var express = require("express");

var PORT = process.env.PORT || 8080;

var app = express();

// Serve static content for the app from the "public" directory in the application directory.
app.use(express.static("public"));

// Parse application body
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use(express.json());

// Set Handlebars.
var exphbs = require("express-handlebars");

app.engine("handlebars", exphbs({ defaultLayout: "main" }));
app.set("view engine", "handlebars");

// Import routes and give the server access to them.
var routes = require("./controllers/catsController.js");

app.use(routes);

// Start our server so that it can begin listening to client requests.
app.listen(PORT, function() {
  // Log (server-side) when our server has started
  console.log("Server listening on: http://localhost:" + PORT);
});

```

This code sets up the server and initializes the middleware for serving static files, parsing request bodies, and setting up Handlebars as the view engine. It also imports the routes from the `catsController.js` file and starts the server.

`config/orm.js`:

```javascript
// Object for all our SQL statement functions.
var orm = {
  all: function(tableInput, cb) {
    var queryString = "SELECT * FROM " + tableInput + ";";
    connection.query(queryString, function(err,

```

The exercise involves building a simple MVC (Model-View-Controller) application for managing cats. MVC is a design pattern that separates an application into three main components: the model, the view, and the controller. The model represents the data and the business logic of the application, the view represents the user interface, and the controller handles user input and communicates with the model and the view.

Here is a brief overview of the files:

-   `readme.md`: contains instructions for the exercise.
-   `package.json`: contains metadata and dependencies for the project.
-   `server.js`: the entry point for the application, sets up the server and handles routing.
-   `config/connection.js`: contains the database connection and ORM functions.
-   `config/orm.js`: contains the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) functions for interacting with the database.
-   `models/cat.js`: represents the cat model and defines the database schema.
-   `controllers/catsController.js`: handles routing for the application.
-   `db/schema.sql`: defines the schema for the database.
-   `db/seeds.sql`: contains sample data for the database.
-   `public/js/cats.js`: contains the client-side JavaScript for the application.
-   `public/css/styles.css`: contains the CSS styling for the application.
-   `views/index.handlebars`: the view for the index page, where users can see all the cats and delete them.
-   `views/layouts/main.handlebars`: the main layout for the application.
-   `views/partials/cat-block.handlebars`: a partial view for displaying a single cat.

To complete the exercise, we need to add a delete button to the index page next to each cat, add a jQuery event handler to the `cats.js` file to handle clicks on the delete button, add a delete key and function to the ORM, add a delete key and function to the cat model that uses the ORM, and add a `/api/cats/:id` delete route to the `catsController.js` file to handle the delete request.

Here is the code and key snippets required to complete the exercise:
1.  Add a delete button to `index.handlebars`:
```handlebars
{{#each cats}}
<div class="cat-block">
  <img src="{{image}}" alt="{{name}}">
  <p>Name: {{name}}</p>
  <p>Age: {{age}}</p>
  <button class="delete-btn" data-id="{{id}}">Delete</button>
</div>
{{/each}}

```

2.  Add a jQuery event handler to `cats.js`:

```javascript
$(function() {
  $(".delete-btn").on("click", function(event) {
    var id = $(this).data("id");

    $.ajax("/api/cats/" + id, {
      type: "DELETE"
    }).then(function() {
      location.reload();
    });
  });
});

```

3.  Add a delete key and function to the ORM:

```javascript
var orm = {
  // ...

  delete: function(table, condition, cb) {
    var queryString = "DELETE FROM " + table;
    queryString += " WHERE ";
    queryString += condition;

    connection.query(queryString, function(err, result) {
      if (err) {
        throw err;
      }
      cb(result);
    });
  }
};

```

4.  Add a delete key and function to the cat model:

```javascript
var cat = {
  all: function(cb) {
    orm.all("cats", function(res) {
      cb(res);
    });
  },
  create: function(cols, vals

```

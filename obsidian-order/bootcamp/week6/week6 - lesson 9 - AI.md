The code consists of an HTML file and a JavaScript code block. The HTML file includes a form to add movies to an array and a section to display the movie data. The JavaScript code includes functions to display movie data and render buttons.

When the page loads, it initializes an array of movies and calls the `renderButtons()` function, which generates a button for each movie in the array and displays them on the page. When a user clicks on one of the generated movie buttons, it calls the `displayMovieInfo()` function. This function is currently incomplete, and the instructions state that the user needs to create the missing code snippets inside the `displayMovieInfo()` function to display JSON data about each movie.

The instructions also provide a hint that HTML `data-` attributes should be used to accomplish this task.

To solve this exercise, one can add the following code snippets inside the `displayMovieInfo()` function:

```javascript
function displayMovieInfo() {
  var movie = $(this).attr("data-name");
  var queryURL = "https://www.omdbapi.com/?t=" + movie + "&apikey=trilogy";

  // Creates AJAX call for the specific movie being 
  $.ajax({
    url: queryURL,
    method: "GET"
  }).then(function(response) {
    var movieDiv = $("<div class='movie'>");
    var title = $("<h1>").text(response.Title);
    var plot = $("<p>").text(response.Plot);
    var released = $("<p>").text("Released: " + response.Released);
    var rating = $("<p>").text("Rating: " + response.Rated);

    movieDiv.append(title);
    movieDiv.append(plot);
    movieDiv.append(released);
    movieDiv.append(rating);

    $("#movie-view").html(movieDiv);
  });
}

```
The above code performs an AJAX call to the OMDb API to retrieve movie data for the clicked movie. It creates a new `div` element with a class of `movie`, and appends various movie data to it, including the movie title, plot, release date, and rating. Finally, it sets the `html` of the `#movie-view` element to the newly created `div` element, effectively displaying the movie data on the page.

In addition to this code, one can add the following line inside the `for` loop of the `renderButtons()` function to set the `data-name` attribute of each generated button:
```css
a.attr("data-name",movies[i]);

```
This code sets the `data-name` attribute of the generated button to the name of the corresponding movie in the `movies` array. This attribute is later used by the `displayMovieInfo()` function to retrieve the correct movie data from the OMDb API.

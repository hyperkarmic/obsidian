The given code is an HTML page that includes a form with a text input and a submit button, as well as a div element with an ID of "artist-div". The goal of the exercise is to use the Bands In Town API to search for an artist specified in the input box and display information about the artist in the "artist-div" element.

The exercise involves making an AJAX request to the Bands In Town API and handling the response to display the desired information in the HTML page. Specifically, the learning outcomes are:

1.  How to make AJAX requests using jQuery
2.  How to handle the response of an AJAX request and parse the data
3.  How to modify the DOM using jQuery to display the desired information.

The key code snippets to solve the exercise are:

1.  Make an AJAX request to the Bands In Town API using jQuery's `$.ajax()` method:

```javascript
function searchBandsInTown(artist) {
  var queryURL = "https://rest.bandsintown.com/artists/" + artist + "?app_id=myAppId";

  $.ajax({
    url: queryURL,
    method: "GET"
  }).then(function(response) {
    // Handle the response here
  });
}

```

In this code snippet, we construct the URL for the API request using the artist name and the app_id parameter. We then use `$.ajax()` to make the GET request to the API, passing in the URL and the HTTP method. We use the `then()` method to handle the response once it is returned from the API.

2.  Parse the data from the response and display it in the HTML page:
```javascript
function searchBandsInTown(artist) {
  var queryURL = "https://rest.bandsintown.com/artists/" + artist + "?app_id=myAppId";

  $.ajax({
    url: queryURL,
    method: "GET"
  }).then(function(response) {
    // Parse the response
    var artistName = response.name;
    var thumbURL = response.thumb_url;
    var numFans = response.tracker_count;
    var numEvents = response.upcoming_event_count;
    var bitURL = response.url;

    // Display the information in the HTML page
    $("#artist-div").empty();
    $("#artist-div").append("<h2>" + artistName + "</h2>");
    $("#artist-div").append("<img src='" + thumbURL + "'>");
    $("#artist-div").append("<p>" + numFans + " fans tracking this artist</p>");
    $("#artist-div").append("<p>" + numEvents + " upcoming events for this artist</p>");
    $("#artist-div").append("<p><a href='" + bitURL + "'>BandsInTown profile</a></p>");
  });
}



```

In this code snippet, we use the data returned from the API response to populate the `#artist-div` element with the artist's name, thumbnail image, number of fans, number of upcoming events, and a link to the artist's profile on BandsInTown. We use jQuery's `empty()` method to clear the previous content of the div before appending the new information.

3.  Prevent the form from submitting when the submit button is clicked:

```javascript
$("#select-artist").on("click", function(event) {
  // Prevent the form from submitting
  event.preventDefault();

  // Get the artist name from the input box
  var artist = $("#artist-input").val().trim();

  // Search for the artist on BandsInTown and display the information
  searchBandsInTown(artist);
});

```

In this code snippet, we use jQuery's `on()` method to attach an event handler to the submit button.

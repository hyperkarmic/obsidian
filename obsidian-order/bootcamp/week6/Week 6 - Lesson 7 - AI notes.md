This is an exercise in dynamically generating HTML elements and handling events in jQuery. The HTML file contains a form with a text input and a submit button, as well as a div with an id of "buttons-view". There is also a JavaScript section with an array of movie titles, a function to display the movie titles as buttons, and an event handler for adding new movies to the array.

The learning outcomes for this exercise include:

-   Creating HTML elements dynamically using jQuery
-   Registering event handlers for HTML elements using jQuery
-   Using jQuery to manipulate the DOM

To replicate the functionality of the application, we need to write code that performs the following tasks:

-   Display the initial array of movie titles as buttons
-   Register an event handler for the "Add a Movie, Yo!" button that adds the entered movie title to the array of movie titles and displays it as a button

Here is a code snippet that displays the initial buttons:

```javascript
function renderButtons() {
  // Empty the buttons-view div to remove any existing buttons
  $("#buttons-view").empty();
  
  // Loop through the movies array and create a button for each movie
  for (var i = 0; i < movies.length; i++) {
    var button = $("<button>");
    button.text(movies[i]);
    $("#buttons-view").append(button);
  }
}
```

This function first empties the buttons-view div using the `empty()` method. It then loops through the movies array and creates a new button element for each movie using the `$("<button>")` syntax. The text of the button is set to the movie title using the `text()` method, and the button is appended to the buttons-view div using the `append()` method.

To register an event handler for the "Add a Movie, Yo!" button, we can modify the existing code as follows:

```javascript
// This function handles events where one button is clicked
$("#add-movie").on("click", function(event) {
  // Prevent the form from submitting
  event.preventDefault();
  
  // Get the value of the movie input field
  var movie = $("#movie-input").val().trim();
  
  // If the movie title is not empty, add it to the movies array and render the buttons again
  if (movie !== "") {
    movies.push(movie);
    renderButtons();
  }
  
  // Clear the movie input field
  $("#movie-input").val("");
});

```

This event handler prevents the form from submitting using the `preventDefault()` method. It then gets the value of the movie input field using the `val()` method and trims any leading or trailing whitespace using the `trim()` method. If the movie title is not empty, it adds it to the movies array using the `push()` method and calls the `renderButtons()` function to display the updated list of buttons. Finally, it clears the movie input field using the `val()` method.

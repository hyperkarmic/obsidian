The given code is a basic HTML file that contains a form to search for movies and an empty div to display the results of an AJAX request. The instructions ask to add functionality to the existing code so that when the user clicks the `Movie Search` button, an AJAX request is sent to the OMDb database with the movie title input by the user, and the JSON response is displayed in the empty `movie-view` div.

To achieve this, we need to use the jQuery library to attach an event listener to the `Movie Search` button, and make an AJAX call to the OMDb API using the `$.ajax()` method. Once the response is received, we need to parse the JSON data and display it in the `movie-view` div using the `.text()` method.

Here is the code that can be added between the dashes to complete the exercise:

```javascript
$.ajax({
  url: queryURL,
  method: "GET"
}).then(function(response) {
  $("#movie-view").text(JSON.stringify(response));
});

```
The above code sends an AJAX GET request to the `queryURL` endpoint using the `$.ajax()` method. The `response` parameter in the `.then()` method is the JSON data returned from the API call. We then use the `.text()` method to set the text content of the `movie-view` div to the stringified JSON data using the `JSON.stringify()` method.

The learning outcomes of this exercise are:

-   How to make an AJAX request using jQuery
-   How to parse and display JSON data on a web page
-   How to use the `preventDefault()` method to prevent a form from being submitted when a button is clicked

This is an exercise to query the OpenWeatherMap API for the current weather data on Bujumbura, Burundi and display the wind speed, humidity, and temperature information in the HTML.

Here are the key points of the exercise:

1.  Query the OpenWeatherMap API for the current weather data on Bujumbura, Burundi.
2.  Log the retrieved data from this query to console.
3.  Parse the retrieved data to display wind speed, humidity, and temperature information into the HTML.
4.  Request an API key from the OpenWeatherMap API website.
5.  Convert the Kelvin temperature provided into Fahrenheit (Bonus).
6.  Use either `bujumbura-easier.html` or `bujumbura-harder.html` as a starting point.

To accomplish these objectives, the following code snippets are needed:

1.  To retrieve data from the OpenWeatherMap API, you need to create an AJAX call with the appropriate URL, including the API key and city ID. You can use jQuery's `$.ajax()` method to create the AJAX call. The following code snippet shows how to create an AJAX call to retrieve the current weather data for Bujumbura, Burundi.

```javascript
$.ajax({
  url: 'http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?id=425378&appid=YOUR_API_KEY',
  method: 'GET',
  success: function(response) {
    console.log(response);
  }
});

```
Note that you need to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key.

2.  To display the retrieved data in the HTML, you need to parse the JSON response and extract the relevant information. Then you can update the corresponding HTML elements with the extracted information. The following code snippet shows how to parse the JSON response and update the HTML elements.
```javascript
$.ajax({
  url: 'http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?id=425378&appid=YOUR_API_KEY',
  method: 'GET',
  success: function(response) {
    console.log(response);
    $('.city').text(response.name);
    $('.wind').text(response.wind.speed + ' m/s');
    $('.humidity').text(response.main.humidity + '%');
    var tempF = (response.main.temp - 273.15) * 1.8 + 32;
    $('.temp').text(tempF.toFixed(2) + ' Â°F');
  }
});



```

Note that the `toFixed()` method is used to round the temperature value to two decimal places.

3.  To convert the Kelvin temperature provided into Fahrenheit, you can use the following formula:

```javascript
var tempF = (tempK - 273.15) * 1.8 + 32;
```
Where `tempK` is the temperature in Kelvin.

4.  Finally, to request an API key from the OpenWeatherMap API website, you need to create an account on their website and follow the instructions to obtain an API key. Once you have the API key, replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in the code snippets with your actual API key.

Remember to test the code in a local environment or web server, and also to handle errors and edge cases.

The code is a JavaScript program that uses AJAX to retrieve and display GIFs of famous people using the Giphy API in response to user button clicks. The program uses jQuery to select the buttons on the page and add event listeners to them.

The learning outcomes of this exercise are:

1.  How to use AJAX to retrieve data from an external API and display it on a web page.
2.  How to use jQuery to select elements on a web page and add event listeners to them.
3.  How to manipulate the DOM using jQuery to dynamically generate HTML content.

To complete the exercise, the user should add three more buttons to the page with a `data-person` attribute and a quote said by a famous person. The user should then open the page in a web browser and test the buttons to ensure that they retrieve and display the correct GIFs.

The following code snippet demonstrates how the program selects the buttons on the page and adds an event listener to them:

```javascript
$("button").on("click", function() {
  // code to retrieve and display GIFs
});

```

This code uses the jQuery selector `$("button")` to select all the buttons on the page and adds an event listener to them that listens for a "click" event. When a user clicks on a button, the event listener executes the code inside the function.

The following code snippet demonstrates how the program retrieves and displays GIFs using AJAX:

```javascript
var person = $(this).attr("data-person");
var queryURL = "https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?q=" +
  person + "&api_key=dc6zaTOxFJmzC&limit=10";

$.ajax({
  url: queryURL,
  method: "GET"
})
  .then(function(response) {
    // code to generate HTML content and display GIFs
  });

```

This code retrieves the `data-person` attribute from the button that was clicked and uses it to construct a query URL for the Giphy API. It then uses the `$.ajax()` method to make an AJAX request to the API, passing in the query URL and the HTTP method "GET". When the AJAX request is successful, the program uses the data returned by the API to generate HTML content and display the GIFs on the page.

The following code snippet demonstrates how the program generates HTML content and displays GIFs:

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < results.length; i++) {
  var gifDiv = $("<div>");

  var rating = results[i].rating;

  var p = $("<p>").text("Rating: " + rating);

  var personImage = $("<img>");
  personImage.attr("src", results[i].images.fixed_height.url);

  gifDiv.prepend(p);
  gifDiv.prepend(personImage);

  $("#gifs-appear-here").prepend(gifDiv);
}

```

This code loops through the `results` array returned by the Giphy API and generates HTML content for each GIF. It creates a `<div>` element to hold the GIF and a `<p>` element to display its rating. It also creates an `<img>` element to display the GIF itself, setting its `src` attribute to the URL of the GIF. Finally, it uses the jQuery method `prepend()` to add the HTML content to the page, adding each GIF to the top of the list of GIFs.

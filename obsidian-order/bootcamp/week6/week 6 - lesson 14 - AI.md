he given code is a basic HTML and jQuery exercise that demonstrates how to use the GIPHY API to search for and display gifs related to an animal.

The exercise requires the user to click on one of the buttons on the page which will trigger an AJAX request to the GIPHY API. The response from the API is then used to display the gifs on the page.

To solve the exercise, the following steps need to be taken:

Step 1: Run the file and click a button to see what the response object looks like in the browser's console. Open up the data key, then open up the 0th, element. Study the keys and how the JSON is structured.

Step 2: Set a variable named `results` equal to `response.data`.

```javascript
var results = response.data;

```

Step 3: Uncomment the `for` loop and create a `div` element with jQuery and store it in a variable named `animalDiv`. Make a `p` tag with jQuery and store it in a variable named `p`. Set the inner text of the `p` tag to the rating of the image in `results[i]`. Make an `img` tag with jQuery and store it in a variable named `animalImage`. Set the image's `src` to `results[i]`'s `fixed_height.url`. Append the `p` variable to the `animalDiv` variable. Append the `animalImage` variable to the `animalDiv` variable. Prepend the `animalDiv` variable to the element with an `id` of `gifs-appear-here`.

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < results.length; i++) {
  var animalDiv = $("<div>");
  var p = $("<p>").text("Rating: " + results[i].rating);
  var animalImage = $("<img>");
  animalImage.attr("src", results[i].images.fixed_height.url);
  animalDiv.append(p);
  animalDiv.append(animalImage);
  $("#gifs-appear-here").prepend(animalDiv);
}

```

Regarding the 401 error, it indicates that the request to the API was unauthorized. This could be due to an invalid API key. To correct the error, the correct API key should be obtained from GIPHY and updated in the `queryURL` variable.

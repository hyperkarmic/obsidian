The given code provides a basic structure for a webpage that displays animated GIFs from the Giphy API, and allows users to pause and play them by clicking on the images. The learning outcomes of this exercise include:

1.  Understanding HTML data attributes and the .attr() method in jQuery.
2.  Understanding how to update the src attribute of an HTML <img> tag.
3.  Understanding how to use if/else statements in JavaScript.
4.  Understanding how to use the click event in jQuery.

To complete this exercise, we need to follow the instructions provided in the comments of the code. Here are the key code snippets with explanations:

1.  Creating a variable to store the data-state attribute of the clicked image:

```javascript
$(".gif").on("click", function() {
  // ...
  var state = $(this).attr("data-state");
  // ...
});

```

Explanation: When an image with the class "gif" is clicked, we want to get the value of its data-state attribute and store it in a variable called "state". We use the .attr() method in jQuery to do this.

2.  Updating the src and data-state attributes of the clicked image

```javascript
$(".gif").on("click", function() {
  // ...
  if (state === "still") {
    $(this).attr("src", $(this).attr("data-animate"));
    $(this).attr("data-state", "animate");
  } else {
    $(this).attr("src", $(this).attr("data-still"));
    $(this).attr("data-state", "still");
  }
  // ...
});

```

Explanation: Depending on the value of the "state" variable, we want to update the src and data-state attributes of the clicked image. If the state is "still", we want to update the src attribute to the value of data-animate, and update the data-state attribute to "animate". If the state is "animate", we want to update the src attribute to the value of data-still, and update the data-state attribute to "still".

3.  Using the click event to trigger the above code:

```javascript
$(".gif").on("click", function() {
  // ...
});
```

	Explanation: We use the click event in jQuery to trigger the code that updates the src and data-state attributes of the clicked image. When an image with the class "gif" is clicked, the function inside the .on() method is executed.

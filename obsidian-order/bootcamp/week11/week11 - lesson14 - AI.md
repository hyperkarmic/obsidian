The code consists of a simple web application that allows users to view, add and search for Star Wars characters. There are two main HTML files: `view.html` and `add.html`, a `server.js` file and a `package.json` file.

The `view.html` file displays two buttons for the user to interact with the application: "Add New Character" and "All Characters". When the "Add New Character" button is clicked, the user is redirected to the `add.html` page. When the "All Characters" button is clicked, a `GET` request is made to the `/api/characters` endpoint to retrieve all of the characters in the database.

The `add.html` file contains a form for the user to add a new character. When the user submits the form, a `POST` request is made to the `/api/characters` endpoint to add the new character to the database.

The `server.js` file sets up the Express server, sets up the necessary middleware, and defines the API endpoints for handling the requests and responses. There are two main endpoints defined in the file: `/api/characters` and `/api/characters/:character`. The former handles `GET` and `POST` requests for getting all characters and adding a new character, respectively. The latter handles `GET` requests for retrieving a specific character by name.

The `$.post` code in the `add.html` file makes a POST request to the `/api/characters` endpoint with the form data entered by the user. This adds a new character to the database.

The learning outcomes of this code are:

-   Building a simple web application using Node.js and Express
-   Understanding HTTP requests and responses
-   Understanding API endpoints and how to handle them using Express
-   Understanding jQuery's `$.get` and `$.post` methods and how to use them to make API requests
-   Understanding how to retrieve and display data from an API using jQuery.

The code consists of two HTML files, `view.html` and `add.html`, and two JavaScript files, `server.js` and `package.json`. The purpose of the application is to display and manage Star Wars character data.

The `view.html` file is the main page of the application, containing a search box, a button to add new characters, and another button to view all characters. When the user types the name of a character in the search box and clicks on the search button, a GET request is sent to the server, which responds with the information about the character. The information is then displayed on the page using jQuery. If the character is not found, an error message is displayed instead.

The `add.html` file is a simple form where the user can input the details of a new character and add it to the database. When the user clicks the "Add Character" button, a POST request is sent to the server, which adds the new character to the database and redirects the user to the main page.

The `server.js` file is the server-side code that handles the HTTP requests and interacts with the database. It uses the Express.js framework to handle routing and middleware. It also uses the Sequelize.js ORM to interact with the MySQL database.

The `package.json` file contains the dependencies required by the application, such as Express.js and Sequelize.js.

The learning outcomes of this code are:

-   How to use jQuery to send HTTP requests and manipulate the DOM
-   How to use Express.js to handle HTTP requests and routing
-   How to use Sequelize.js to interact with a MySQL database

Here's an explanation of the key code snippets:

In `view.html`, when the user clicks the search button, a GET request is sent to the server with the name of the character in the search box as a parameter:

```javascript
$.get("/api/characters/" + searchedCharacter, function(data) {
  // code to display character data
});

```

In `server.js`, the route for handling the GET request is defined as follows:

```javascript
app.get("/api/characters/:character", function(req, res) {
  // code to query the database for the character and send the response
});

```

In `add.html`, when the user clicks the "Add Character" button, a POST request is sent to the server with the details of the new character:

```javascript
$.post("/api/characters", newCharacter, function() {
  // code to redirect to main page
});

```
In `server.js`, the route for handling the POST request is defined as follows:

```javascript
app.post("/api/characters", function(req, res) {
  // code to add the new character to the database and send the response
});

```

The `server3.js` file is a simple Node.js web server that serves a list of Star Wars characters as a JSON API. It uses the Express web framework to define the routes and handle HTTP requests.

The server listens on port 3000, and has two routes defined:

-   The root route ("/") simply returns a welcome message.
-   The "/api/characters" route returns the full list of Star Wars characters as a JSON object.
-   The "/api/characters/:character" route returns a single Star Wars character based on the character's `routeName` property, which is passed as a URL parameter.

The `characters` variable is an array of JavaScript objects, each of which represents a single Star Wars character. Each character has a `routeName`, `name`, `role`, `age`, and `forcePoints` property.

The `package.json` file is a standard Node.js package descriptor, which defines the name of the package, its version, and its dependencies on other packages. In this case, the package has a dependency on the "express" package, which is used to run the web server.

Learning outcomes:

-   Understand how to create a basic web server using Node.js and Express.
-   Understand how to define routes and handle HTTP requests using Express.
-   Understand how to use URL parameters to retrieve data from a web server.

The code in `server.js` creates an HTTP server that listens on port 8080. When a request is received, it parses the URL path and responds with different content depending on the path requested.

The `handleRequest()` function is the main request handler. It takes in two arguments, `req` and `res`, which represent the request and response objects respectively. The function uses a `switch` statement to determine which path was requested and calls the appropriate function to generate the response.

The `displayRoot()` function generates the response for the root path ("/"). It returns a simple HTML page with a heading and a link to the "/portfolio" path.

The `displayPortfolio()` function generates the response for the "/portfolio" path. It returns a simple HTML page with a heading and a link back to the root path ("/").

The `display404()` function generates a 404 error page for any other path that is requested. It returns an HTML page with a heading and a message indicating that the requested page could not be found.

Finally, the code creates the HTTP server using the `createServer()` method and passes in the `handleRequest()` function as the request handler. The server is then set to listen on port 8080 using the `listen()` method.

To create a similar server with different content for different paths, you can follow the structure of this code and modify the response content of each function accordingly. For example, you could create a function called `displayAbout()` that generates the response for the "/about" path and returns an HTML page with information about yourself or your company. Then, you would add a new case to the `switch` statement in the `handleRequest()` function to handle the "/about" path and call the `displayAbout()` function.

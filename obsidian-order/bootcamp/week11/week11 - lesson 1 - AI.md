This is a simple Node.js server that listens for requests on port 8080 and responds with a message that includes the path that was requested.

The code starts by importing the built-in Node.js `http` module and assigning it to the `http` constant.

Next, a constant `PORT` is defined with a value of 8080, which is the port the server will listen on.

After that, a function `handleRequest` is defined with two parameters `request` and `response`. This function is called each time a request is made to the server. In this case, it simply sends back a response with a message that includes the path that was requested.

Then, a server is created with the `http.createServer` method and the `handleRequest` function is passed as an argument.

Finally, the `server.listen` method is called with the `PORT` constant and a callback function that logs a message to the console when the server starts listening.

Learning outcomes:

This code demonstrates how to create a basic Node.js server that listens for requests and responds to them. It also shows how to use the built-in `http` module to handle HTTP requests and responses.

Code snippets:

1.  Importing the `http` module:

```javascript
const http = require("http");

```

This line of code imports the built-in `http` module in Node.js, which is used to create an HTTP server and handle HTTP requests and responses.

2.  Defining the `handleRequest` function:

```javascript
const handleRequest = (request, response) => {
  response.end("It Works!! Path Hit: " + request.url);
};

```

This function is called each time a request is made to the server. It takes two parameters, `request` and `response`, which represent the incoming request and the outgoing response, respectively. In this case, it simply sends back a response with a message that includes the path that was requested.

3.  Creating the server:

```javascript
const server = http.createServer(handleRequest);

```
This line of code creates a new HTTP server using the `http.createServer` method and passes the `handleRequest` function as an argument. This sets up the server to handle incoming requests using the logic defined in `handleRequest`.

4.  Starting the server:

```javascript
server.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on: http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});

```

This line of code starts the server listening on the specified port (`PORT`), and logs a message to the console to confirm that the server has started listening. When the server is running, it will handle incoming requests and respond with the appropriate response.

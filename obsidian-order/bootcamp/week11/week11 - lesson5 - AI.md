To create the website with the required four routes, we can use Node.js with the built-in `http` module and `fs` module. Here's an overview of the steps we can take:

1.  Create an HTTP server using the `http.createServer()` method.
2.  Define a callback function to handle incoming requests.
3.  Use the `req.url` property to determine which route is being requested.
4.  Use the `fs.readFile()` method to read the HTML file for the requested route.
5.  Send the HTML content to the client using the `res.end()` method.
6.  Add links to the home page that navigate to the other pages.

Here's the code that would accomplish these steps:

```javascript
const http = require('http');
const fs = require('fs');
const PORT = 8080;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  // Determine which HTML file to serve based on the URL
  let filePath = './';
  switch (req.url) {
    case '/':
      filePath += 'home.html';
      break;
    case '/favorite-foods':
      filePath += 'favorite-foods.html';
      break;
    case '/favorite-movies':
      filePath += 'favorite-movies.html';
      break;
    case '/favorite-css-frameworks':
      filePath += 'favorite-css-frameworks.html';
      break;
    default:
      // If the URL doesn't match any of the above routes, serve a 404 page
      filePath += '404.html';
  }

  // Read the HTML file and send it to the client
  fs.readFile(filePath, (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
      // If there's an error reading the file, serve a 500 error page
      res.writeHead(500, { 'Content-Type': 'text/html' });
      res.end('<html><body><h1>500 Internal Server Error</h1></body></html>');
      return;
    }

    // Serve the HTML file with a 200 status code
    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/html' });
    res.end(data);
  });
});

// Start the server
server.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${PORT}...`);
});

```

Here are some additional explanations and comments on the code:

-   We use a switch statement to determine which HTML file to serve based on the URL requested by the client.
-   If the requested URL doesn't match any of the defined routes, we serve a 404 page by appending `404.html` to the base file path.
-   We use the `fs.readFile()` method to read the HTML file asynchronously. If there's an error reading the file, we serve a 500 error page.
-   Once the file is read, we send it to the client with a 200 status code using the `res.end()` method.
-   We start the server listening on the specified port using the `server.listen()` method.
-   To add links to the home page, we can edit the `home.html` file and add anchor tags that point to the other pages. For example, `<a href="/favorite-foods">Favorite Foods</a>` would create a link to the favorite foods page.

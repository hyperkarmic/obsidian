The code is a basic Node.js and Express.js server that displays some Star Wars data. The server listens on port 3000 and has two existing routes - "/yoda" and "/darthmaul" - which display Yoda's and Darth Maul's data, respectively. The objective is to create a new route that displays Obi Wan Kenobi's data.

Explanation of server.js:

-   Dependencies: The server.js file requires the "express" package, which is assigned to the variable "express".
-   Data: There are two objects containing information about Yoda and Darth Maul. The task requires creating a new object for Obi Wan Kenobi.
-   Routes:
    -   "/" route sends a response to the client with the message "Welcome to the Star Wars Page!".
    -   "/yoda" route sends a response to the client with the JSON object of Yoda.
    -   "/darthmaul" route sends a response to the client with the JSON object of Darth Maul.
    -   The task is to create a new route for Obi Wan Kenobi.
-   Listener: The server listens on port 3000.

Explanation of package.json:

-   The name of the project is "starwars-express".
-   The entry point for the project is "server1.js".
-   The "express" package is installed and listed as a dependency.
-   There are three scripts: "test", "start", and "watch". "start" runs "node server1.js" and "watch" runs "nodemon server1.js".

Code Snippets:

1.  Creating a new data entry for Obi Wan Kenobi:

```javascript
var obiwankenobi = {
  name: "Obi Wan Kenobi",
  role: "Jedi Master",
  age: 57,
  forcePoints: 1350
};

```

2.  Creating a new route for Obi Wan Kenobi:

```javascript
app.get("/obiwankenobi", function(req, res) {
  res.json(obiwankenobi);
});

```

3.  Starting the server:

```javascript
app.listen(PORT, function() {
  console.log("App listening on PORT " + PORT);
});

```

The code provided in the files is a simple Express.js server that serves a RESTful API of Star Wars characters. The server is set up to handle data parsing using the Express.js built-in middleware function, `express.urlencoded` and `express.json`. The server listens to requests on port 3000, and has three API endpoints:

1.  A GET endpoint `/api/characters` that returns an array of Star Wars characters in JSON format.
2.  A GET endpoint `/api/characters/:character` that takes a character's name as a parameter, and returns a single Star Wars character in JSON format if the character exists in the array. If the character doesn't exist in the array, the server responds with "No character found".
3.  A POST endpoint `/api/characters` that allows the client to create a new Star Wars character by sending a JSON object in the request body. The new character is then added to the `characters` array, and the server responds with the newly created character in JSON format.

The `package.json` file lists the dependencies required for the server to function properly, namely the `express` library. The `start` script in the `scripts` section of the file starts the server by running the `server5.js` file using Node.js.

The `readme.js` file provides instructions for the developer on how to use the server, specifically how to research `express.json`, `req.body`, and how to use Postman to send a POST request to the server.

Key code snippets to understand in this exercise include:

1.  Setting up the Express app to handle data parsing using the built-in middleware functions `express.urlencoded` and `express.json`:

```javascript
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use(express.json());

```

2.  Creating a GET endpoint that returns an array of characters in JSON format:

```javascript
app.get("/api/characters", function(req, res) {
  return res.json(characters);
});

```

3.  Creating a GET endpoint that takes a character's name as a parameter and returns a single character in JSON format if the character exists in the `characters` array:

```javascript
app.get("/api/characters/:character", function(req, res) {
  var chosen = req.params.character;

  for (var i = 0; i < characters.length; i++) {
    if (chosen === characters[i].routeName) {
      return res.json(characters[i]);
    }
  }

  return res.send("No character found");

});

```

4.  Creating a POST endpoint that allows the client to create a new character by sending a JSON object in the request body:

```javascript
app.post("/api/characters", function(req, res) {
  var newCharacter = req.body;

  characters.push(newCharacter);

  res.json(newCharacter);
});

```

Some useful additional explanations for developers may include:

1.  `express.urlencoded()` and `express.json()` are middleware functions in Express.js that are used to parse incoming request bodies before the request handlers. `express.urlencoded()` is used to parse URL-encoded request bodies, while `express.json()` is used to parse JSON request bodies.
2.  The `req.body` property is an object containing the parsed request body of a POST or PUT request. It is populated by the `express.json()` and `express.urlencoded()` middleware functions.
3.  Postman is a popular API development tool that allows developers to make HTTP requests and test APIs. It can be used to test the POST endpoint of the server in this exercise by sending a JSON object in the request body.

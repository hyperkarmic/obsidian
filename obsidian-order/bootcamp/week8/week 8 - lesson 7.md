The code provided in the exercise will use the `fs` module of Node.js to create a "commit logger" that records commit messages (for poetic purposes). The `fs` module is used to interact with the file system, and it has a method `appendFile` which can be used to append data to a file.

To complete this exercise, we need to create a Node.js application named `index.js` that accepts a command-line argument and appends it to a file named `commit.log` without overwriting the existing text.

Here's the code that solves the exercise:

```javascript

const fs = require('fs');

const commitMessage = process.argv[1];
//note we changed number as there were only two arguments!!!
console.log(process.argv)
fs.appendFile('commit.log', commitMessage + '\n', function(err) {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err);
    return;
  }
  console.log(`Commit message "${commitMessage}" has been added to commit.log`);
});

```

this creates and appends to the commit.log file

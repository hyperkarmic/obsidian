Inquirer is a Node.js library that provides a set of prompts for the terminal. It can be used to easily create a command-line interface (CLI) for your Node.js applications. The prompts can be used to ask the user questions, receive input, and make decisions based on the responses.

To use the inquirer library, you first need to install it using npm. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```javascript
npm install inquirer

```

Once installed, you can import it into your Node.js application using the require function:

```javascript
const inquirer = require('inquirer');

```

The inquirer library provides a variety of prompt types, including:

-   Input: Allows the user to enter a free-form text input.
-   Confirm: Asks the user to confirm a yes/no question.
-   List: Asks the user to choose one item from a list of options.
-   Rawlist: Asks the user to choose one item from a list of options without showing the key.
-   Checkbox: Asks the user to choose multiple items from a list of options.
-   Password: Asks the user to enter a password.

To use a prompt, you simply call the appropriate function on the inquirer object and provide a configuration object that describes the prompt. For example, to ask the user for their name using an input prompt, you could use the following code:

```javascript
inquirer.prompt({
  type: 'input',
  name: 'name',
  message: 'What is your name?'
}).then((answers) => {
  console.log(`Hello ${answers.name}!`);
});

```

This will display a prompt in the terminal that asks the user "What is your name?" and then waits for the user to enter a response. Once the user has entered their name, the `then` method will be called, passing an object containing the user's response.

Overall, inquirer is a very useful library for building interactive command-line applications, and its simplicity makes it easy to use even for beginners.

This exercise is aimed at helping you understand and use the spread and rest operators in JavaScript.

The spread operator is used to expand an iterable like an array, object or string into individual elements. This allows you to pass multiple arguments to a function, create a new array or object from an existing one, or concatenate multiple arrays or objects.

The rest operator is used to collect multiple elements into an array. This allows you to pass an arbitrary number of arguments to a function as an array, which you can then manipulate using array methods.

The `index.js` file contains two exercises to help you practice using these operators:

1.  **Copying an array into another array using spread**:
    
    This exercise demonstrates how to use the spread operator to copy an array. The `songs` array is defined at the beginning of the file. To copy this array into a new array, we use the spread operator `...` and assign the result to a new variable `new_songs`. We then console.log the new array to verify that it contains the same elements as the original array.
    
2.  **Modifying the addition function to use the rest operator**:
    
    This exercise demonstrates how to use the rest operator to collect an arbitrary number of arguments into an array. The `addition` function takes three arguments and returns their sum. To modify this function to use the rest operator, we replace the function signature with `function addition(...array)`, which collects all the arguments passed to the function into an array called `array`. We can then use the `reduce` method to sum up the values in the array and return the result.
    

Here's the code for each exercise, along with some key code snippets and explanations:

1.  Copying an array into another array using spread:

```javascript
const songs = ["Creep", "Everlong", "Bulls On Parade", "Song 2", "What I Got"];
const new_songs = [...songs];
console.log(new_songs); // => ["Creep", "Everlong", "Bulls On Parade", "Song 2", "What I Got"];

```

In this code snippet, we define an array called `songs` containing five string elements. We then create a new array called `new_songs` by spreading the `songs` array into individual elements using the spread operator `...`. We then console.log `new_songs` to verify that it contains the same elements as `songs`.

2.  Modifying the addition function to use the rest operator:

```javascript
function addition(x, y, z) {
  const array = [x, y, z];
  return array.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
}
console.log(addition(1, 2, 3)); // 6

function addition(...array) {
  return array.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
}
console.log(addition(1, 2, 3)); // 6
console.log(addition(1, 2, 3, 4, 100)); // 110

```

In this code snippet, we define a function called `addition` that takes three arguments `x`, `y`, and `z`. The function creates an array called `array` containing these arguments, and then uses the `reduce` method to sum up the values in the array and return the result.

We then modify the function to use the rest operator by changing the function signature to `function addition(...array)`. This allows us to collect an arbitrary number of arguments into an array called `array`. We can then use the same `reduce` method to sum up the values in the `array` and return the result.

We then test the function by calling it

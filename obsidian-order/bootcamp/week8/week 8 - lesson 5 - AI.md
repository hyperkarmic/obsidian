This code reads the contents of a file named `data.csv` and logs the contents of the file to the console.

The code first imports the Node.js `fs` (file system) module, which provides an API for interacting with the file system.

Then, the `fs.readFile()` method is called with three arguments: the name of the file to be read (`data.csv`), an encoding parameter (`utf8`), and a callback function that will be called once the file has been read.

The callback function takes two parameters: an error parameter and a data parameter. If there is an error reading the file, the error parameter will be populated and the function will log the error to the console. Otherwise, the contents of the file will be stored in the `data` variable and logged to the console.

Learning outcomes:

-   Reading files using Node.js
-   Using the `fs` module to interact with the file system
-   Handling errors in asynchronous callbacks.

This is a simple Node.js program that uses the built-in `fs` (file system) module to write data to a file called `log.txt`.

The program takes a command-line argument and writes it to the file using the `writeFile` method. If the operation is successful, the program prints "Success!" to the console.

Here's an explanation of the code snippet:

```javascript
var fs = require("fs");

```

This line imports the `fs` module from the Node.js standard library.

This line calls the `writeFile` method of the `fs` module, passing in three arguments:

1.  `"log.txt"` - the name of the file to write to.
2.  `process.argv[2]` - the second command-line argument passed to the program. This will be the content of the file.
3.  A callback function that will be called when the write operation completes. If an error occurs, the `err` parameter will contain information about the error.

```javascript
if (err) {
  return console.log(err);
}

```

This block of code checks if an error occurred during the write operation. If an error occurred, it prints the error to the console and returns from the function to prevent any further code from executing.

```javascript
console.log("Success!");
```

If the write operation was successful, this line prints "Success!" to the console.

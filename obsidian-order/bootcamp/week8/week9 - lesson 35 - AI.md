The code in this exercise demonstrates how to make an HTTP request to an external API and write the response data to a file using the Node.js file system module (`fs`). It also demonstrates how to read from a file and output the file contents to the console. The exercise specifically involves getting a random joke from the `icanhazdadjoke` API, appending the joke to a file named `jokes.txt`, and then reading and outputting all saved jokes from the file.

The `index.js` file first requires the `fs`, `util`, and `axios` modules. It then creates `promisified` versions of the `fs.appendFile()` and `fs.readFile()` functions using the `util.promisify()` method. The `axios.get()` method makes a GET request to the `icanhazdadjoke` API with a `config` object that specifies the `accept` header as `application/json`. Once the response is received, the `joke` property is extracted from the response data and appended to the `jokes.txt` file using `fs.appendFileAsync()`. The file contents are then read and outputted to the console using `fs.readFileAsync()`. Finally, error handling is done using the `catch()` method to log any errors to the console.

The `package.json` file specifies the name of the project, the main script to be executed (`index.js`), and the dependencies required for the project (`axios` in this case).

Some key code snippets include:

-   Creating promisified versions of `fs.appendFile()` and `fs.readFile()`:

```javascript
const appendFileAsync = util.promisify(fs.appendFile);
const readFileAsync = util.promisify(fs.readFile);

```

Making a GET request to the `icanhazdadjoke` API with `axios.get()`:

```javascript
axios
  .get("https://icanhazdadjoke.com/", config)
  .then(function(res) {
    // ...
  })
  .catch(function(err) {
    // ...
  });

```

Appending the `joke` property of the response data to the `jokes.txt` file:

```javascript
return appendFileAsync("jokes.txt", joke + "\n");

```

Reading the contents of the `jokes.txt` file and outputting them to the console:

```javascript
return readFileAsync("jokes.txt", "utf8");
// ...
console.log(data);

```

Handling errors using the `catch()` method:

```javascript
.catch(function(err) {
  console.log(err);
});

```

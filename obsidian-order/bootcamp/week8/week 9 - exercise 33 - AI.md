This code exercise utilizes the `axios` library to make a GET request to the Github API, and then saves a list of the user's repositories to a file.

The code starts with the `index.js` file, which first imports the necessary modules, `fs`, `axios`, and `inquirer`. It then uses `inquirer` to prompt the user for their Github username. After the user enters their username, the code constructs a URL to query the Github API and uses `axios` to send a GET request to that URL. The response object returned from the request should contain a `data` property, which is an array of the user's Github repos.

The code then uses the `map` method to loop through the array of repos and save only the names of the repos to an array. It then uses the `join` method to join the array of repo names to a string separated with a newline character (`\n`). Finally, it uses the `fs.writeFile` method to save the string containing the repo names to a new `repos.txt` file. Once this completes, the code prints a message to the console indicating the number of repos saved.

The `package.json` file lists the dependencies required for this project, which are `axios` and `inquirer`.

Some key code snippets for understanding this exercise are:

1.  Using `axios` to send a GET request to the Github API:

```javascript

axios.get(queryUrl).then(function(res) {
    // handle response
});

```

This code uses the `axios` module to send a GET request to the `queryUrl` constructed earlier. The `then` method is used to handle the response.

2.  Looping through the array of repos and saving only the names of the repos to an array:

```javascript
const repoNames = res.data.map(function(repo) {
    return repo.name;
});

```
3.  Saving the string containing the repo names to a new `repos.txt` file:

```javascript
fs.writeFile("repos.txt", repoNamesStr, function(err) {
    if (err) {
        throw err;
    }
    console.log(`Saved ${repoNames.length} repos`);
});

```


This code uses the `fs.writeFile` method to save the string containing the repo names to a new file named `repos.txt`. If there is an error, it throws an error. Otherwise, it prints a message to the console indicating the number of repos saved.

The main learning outcomes of this exercise are using `axios` to send a GET request to an API and handling the response, using the `map` method to loop through an array and return only certain values, and using `fs.writeFile` to save data to a file. Additionally, it demonstrates the use of `inquirer` to prompt the user for input.

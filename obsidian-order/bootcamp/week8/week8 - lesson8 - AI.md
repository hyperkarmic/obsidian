The code consists of two files, `index.js` and `badmath.js`. The `index.js` file imports the `badmath.js` file using `require()` and then accesses the `pie` and `predictable()` variables that are exported from `badmath.js`.

The `badmath.js` file exports an object containing two properties, `pie` and `predictable`. The `pie` property has the value of a variable `pie` which is not defined in this module, so it will cause an error when accessed from another module. The `predictable` property has the value of a function `predictable` which is also not defined in this module, so it will also cause an error when accessed from another module.

To fix this, we need to define `pie` and `predictable` in `badmath.js` before exporting them.

```javascript
// Define pie and predictable
var pie = "apple";

var predictable = function() {
  return 1;
};

// Export pie and predictable
module.exports = {
  pie: pie,
  predictable: predictable
};

```
This code defines `pie` and `predictable` in the same module where they are being exported from. Now when `index.js` imports `badmath.js`, it will be able to access `pie` and `predictable()` without any errors.

Key code snippets:

Defining variables and functions in `badmath.js`:


```javascript
// Define pie and predictable
var pie = "apple";

var predictable = function() {
  return 1;
};

```

xporting variables and functions from `badmath.js`

```javascript
// Export pie and predictable
module.exports = {
  pie: pie,
  predictable: predictable
};

```

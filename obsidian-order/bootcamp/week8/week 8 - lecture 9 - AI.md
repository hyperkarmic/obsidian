The given code requires the creation of a custom maths module to perform basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These operations can be performed based on command-line arguments passed to the index.js file. The learning outcomes of this exercise include the following:

-   Understanding the Node.js module system and how to create and use custom modules.
-   Understanding how to use the `process.argv` object to access command-line arguments.
-   Implementing basic arithmetic operations in JavaScript functions.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

-   `maths.js`: This file exports four functions to perform basic mathematical operations, i.e., `sum`, `difference`, `product`, and `quotient`.
-   `index.js`: This file imports the `maths` module and retrieves the command-line arguments using the `process.argv` object. It then uses a `switch` statement to call the appropriate `maths` function based on the first argument.

To test the code, we can run the `index.js` file with the appropriate command-line arguments like so:

```javascript
node index.js sum 3 4
```

This should output `7`, which is the result of adding `3` and `4`.

This code is a simple example of using a for...of loop to add a class to a collection of elements.

The readme.md file explains the task of the exercise, which is to select all the songs in the HTML file and add a class to change their color to red.

In the index.js file, the code selects all the list items (li) inside the unordered list (ul) using the `querySelectorAll()` method, and stores them in the `songs` variable. Then, it uses a for...of loop to iterate through the collection of songs, and adds the class "green" to each one using the `classList.add()` method.

Finally, the style.css file defines the "green" class with a CSS rule that changes the color of the text to green.

The key takeaway from this exercise is to understand how to use the for...of loop to iterate through a collection of elements and perform an action on each one. Additionally, it demonstrates how to use the `classList` property to add and remove classes from HTML elements, and how to define CSS rules for those classes in a separate CSS file.

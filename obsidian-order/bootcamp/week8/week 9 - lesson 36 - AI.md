The code in index.js is a demonstration of how to read the contents of a file asynchronously in Node.js. It defines a function, `readFileAsync`, that takes a file path and an encoding as arguments, and returns a promise that resolves to the contents of the file as a string. The function uses the `fs.readFile` method to read the file, passing a callback function that resolves the promise with the file contents if there are no errors, or rejects it with the error if there are.

The `onResolve` and `onReject` functions defined after `readFileAsync` are callbacks that handle the promise resolution and rejection, respectively. They simply log the data or error to the console.

The `example.txt` file contains the string "Hello World!".

When the program is run, `readFileAsync` is called with the file path "example.txt" and the encoding "utf8", and then a `.then` callback is added to log the file contents to the console when the promise is resolved. If there is an error reading the file, a `.catch` callback is added to log the error to the console.

To run the program, the user must have Node.js installed, and can run `node index.js` in the terminal while in the same directory as the `index.js` and `example.txt` files.

A key code snippet in this example is the `readFileAsync` function that reads the contents of a file asynchronously using promises:

```javascript
function readFileAsync(path, encoding) {
  const executor = (resolve, reject) => {
    const callback = (err, data) => (err ? reject(err) : resolve(data));
    fs.readFile(path, encoding, callback);
  };

  return new Promise(executor);
}

```

This code defines a `Promise` that is resolved or rejected based on the result of `fs.readFile`. The function takes the file path and encoding as arguments, and returns a promise that resolves to the file contents as a string if the file is read successfully. The `Promise` constructor takes an executor function that defines the `resolve` and `reject` callbacks, and returns the `Promise` object. In this case, the executor function is defined using an arrow function that takes the `resolve` and `reject` callbacks as arguments, and returns the `fs.readFile` method with a callback function. The callback function takes an `err` argument that is either `null` or an error object, and a `data` argument that contains the file contents if there are no errors. The callback function checks if there is an error by testing the truthiness of the `err` argument, and if there is, rejects the promise with the error object. If there is no error, the promise is resolved with the file contents as a string.

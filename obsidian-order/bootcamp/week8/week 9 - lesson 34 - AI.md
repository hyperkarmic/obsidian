This code is a simple demonstration of Node.js file system (fs) module and the Promises feature of Node.js. The code reads data from the `animals.json` file, filters the data for dogs and cats, and writes the resulting JSON data to two new files, `dogs.json` and `cats.json`, respectively.

The `index.js` file contains the main code for the program. It first imports the necessary modules - `fs` and `util`. The `fs` module provides an API for interacting with the file system, while the `util` module is used to promisify Node.js' callback-based functions. The `isAnimal` function is imported from the `animal.js` file.

The `processAnimals` function takes in the data from the `animals.json` file, parses it as JSON, and filters the data for dogs and cats using the `isAnimal` function. It then uses `JSON.stringify` to convert the filtered data to a JSON string and writes the resulting JSON data to two separate files, `dogs.json` and `cats.json`, using the `writeFileAsync` function. This function returns a Promise that resolves when the data has been successfully written to the file. If the Promise resolves successfully, a message is logged to the console indicating that the file was successfully written.

The `animal.js` file exports the `isAnimal` function, which is a higher-order function that takes in a `species` argument and returns another function that takes in an `animal` object as an argument. The returned function checks whether the `species` property of the `animal` object is equal to the `species` argument passed to the `isAnimal` function. If the `species` property matches, the function returns `true`, indicating that the `animal` object is of the specified `species`.

The `animals.json`, `cats.json`, and `dogs.json` files are JSON files that contain data about animals. The `animals.json` file contains data about both dogs and cats, while the `cats.json` and `dogs.json` files contain data only about cats and dogs, respectively.

The learning outcomes of this exercise include understanding the following concepts:

-   Reading and writing files using Node.js' `fs` module
-   Promisifying callback-based functions using Node.js' `util` module
-   Filtering JSON data based on certain criteria using higher-order functions

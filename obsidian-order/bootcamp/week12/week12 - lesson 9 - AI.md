The given code consists of three files: iceCreamCrud.js, iceCreamSeeds.sql, and package.json. The files are part of an application that manages ice cream products. The iceCreamSeeds.sql file contains SQL statements that create and seed a MySQL database with the necessary products table. The iceCreamCrud.js file creates a MySQL connection and implements four C.R.U.D. operations: createProduct, updateProduct, deleteProduct, and readProducts. Finally, the package.json file lists the dependencies required for the application to run.

Learning outcomes:

-   Familiarity with MySQL and creating a database and table using SQL statements.
-   Understanding how to create a connection to a MySQL database from a Node.js application using the mysql package.
-   Understanding how to implement C.R.U.D. operations in a Node.js application with a MySQL database.
-   Understanding how to use the console.log function to output information to the terminal for debugging purposes.
-   Familiarity with the package.json file and how to list dependencies required for an application to run.

Code snippets:

1.  Creating a connection to a MySQL database using the mysql package:

```javascript
var mysql = require("mysql");

var connection = mysql.createConnection({
  host: "localhost",
  port: 3306,
  user: "root",
  password: "",
  database: "ice_creamDB"
});

connection.connect(function(err) {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log("connected as id " + connection.threadId + "\n");
  // code to execute after connection is established
});

```

Explanation: The mysql package provides a createConnection() function that takes an object containing the connection details, such as the host, port, user, password, and database name. Once the connection is established, the code inside the connection.connect() function is executed.

2.  Creating a table and seeding it with data using SQL statements:
```javascript
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS ice_creamDB;

CREATE DATABASE ice_creamDB;

USE ice_creamDB;

CREATE TABLE products (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  flavor VARCHAR(45) NULL,
  price DECIMAL(10,2) NULL,
  quantity INT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

INSERT INTO products (flavor, price, quantity)
VALUES ("vanilla", 2.50, 100);

INSERT INTO products (flavor, price, quantity)
VALUES ("chocolate", 3.10, 120);

INSERT INTO products (flavor, price, quantity)
VALUES ("strawberry", 3.25, 75);

```

Explanation: The SQL statements are used to create a new database called "ice_creamDB" if it doesn't already exist, and then create a table called "products" with columns for the id, flavor, price, and quantity of each ice cream product. Finally, the table is seeded with three initial rows of data.

3.  Implementing a C.R.U.D. operation to insert new data into the database:

```javascript
function createProduct() {
  console.log("Inserting a new product...\n");
  var query = connection.query(
    "INSERT INTO products SET ?",
    {
      flavor: "Rocky Road",
      price: 3.0,
      quantity: 50
    },
    function(err, res) {
      if (err) throw err;
      console.log(res.affectedRows + " product inserted!\n");
      // Call updateProduct AFTER the INSERT completes
      updateProduct();
    }
  );

  // logs the actual query being run
  console.log(query.sql);
}

```

Explanation: The createProduct() function inserts a new row of data into the products table with values for flavor, price, and quantity. The query

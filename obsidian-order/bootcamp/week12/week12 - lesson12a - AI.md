Overview of the code and learning outcomes:

The code consists of a Node.js application that interacts with a MySQL database. It reads data from CSV files, imports the data into the database, and allows users to query the data using a console interface.

Learning outcomes:

-   Creating a database and tables using SQL
-   Importing data from CSV files into a MySQL database
-   Querying a MySQL database using Node.js
-   Using the Node.js Readline module to read input from the console
-   Building a command-line interface (CLI) for a Node.js application

Code explanation:

The code consists of several files and directories:

-   `src/`: Contains the main application code.
    -   `app.js`: The main application code. It connects to the database, imports data from CSV files, and prompts the user for input to execute queries against the database.
    -   `utils.js`: Contains utility functions used by the main application code.
-   `data/`: Contains CSV files with data to import into the database.
-   `db/`: Contains the schema and seed files used to create the database and tables, and insert data.
    -   `schema.sql`: Creates the `top_songsDB` database and the `Top5000` table.
    -   `seed.sql`: Inserts the first three songs from `TopSongs.csv` into the `Top5000` table.
-   `README.md`: Contains instructions for setting up and running the application.
-   `package.json`: Contains metadata about the application and its dependencies.

Here are some key code snippets:

Connecting to the database in `app.js`:

```javascript
const mysql = require('mysql');
const { promisify } = require('util');

const dbConfig = {
  host: 'localhost',
  user: 'root',
  password: 'password',
  database: 'top_songsDB',
};

const dbConnection = mysql.createConnection(dbConfig);

// Promisify the connection.query method to allow for async/await
dbConnection.queryAsync = promisify(dbConnection.query).bind(dbConnection);

dbConnection.connect((err) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(`Connected to database ${dbConfig.database}`);
});

```

This code sets up a connection to the MySQL database using the `mysql` package, and uses the `promisify` function from the built-in `util` module to convert the callback-based `query` method to a Promise-based method. It also logs a message to the console to indicate that the connection was successful.

Reading input from the console in `app.js`:

```javascript 

const readline = require('readline');

const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout,
});

rl.question('Enter a query: ', async (query) => {
  console.log(`Query: ${query}`);

  // Execute the query against the database
  const results = await dbConnection.queryAsync(query);

  // Print the results
  console.log(results);

  rl.close();
});


```

This code uses the `readline` module from Node.js to create a CLI that prompts the user for input. It waits for the user to enter a query, then executes the query against the database and prints the results. It then closes the readline interface.

Importing data from CSV files in `utils.js`:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const csv = require('csv-parser');
const { promisify } = require('util');

const readFileAsync = promisify(fs.readFile);

async function importDataFromFile(filePath, tableName, dbConnection) {
  const data = await readFileAsync(filePath);

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const rows = [];

    // Parse the CSV data using the csv-parser package
    const

```

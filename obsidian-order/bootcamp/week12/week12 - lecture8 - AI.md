vaScript code for connecting to the MySQL server, querying the `songs` table in the `playlist_db` database, and printing the results to the console. The code also includes a function for querying the `songs` table based on genre or artist, and printing the results to the console. The code also demonstrates how to use placeholders in a query to allow for dynamic querying.

The `package.json` file is used for managing dependencies, and includes the `mysql` package as a dependency.

To run the code, first make sure the MySQL server is running, then navigate to the directory containing the `playlistReadData.js` file and run the following command:

```javascript
node playlistReadData.js

```

This will execute the JavaScript code and output the results to the console.

Here is a breakdown of the code in `playlistReadData.js`:

```javascript
var mysql = require("mysql");

```

This line imports the `mysql` package, which provides methods for interacting with a MySQL database.

```javascript
var connection = mysql.createConnection({
  host: "localhost",
  port: 3306,
  user: "root",
  password: "",
  database: "playlist_db"
});

```

This code creates a connection to the MySQL server using the `mysql` package. The configuration options for the connection include the host, port, username, password, and database name.

```javascript
connection.connect(function(err) {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log("connected as id " + connection.threadId);
  afterConnection();
});

```

This code connects to the MySQL server using the connection object created earlier. The `connect()` method takes a callback function that is called once the connection is established. In this code, the callback function checks for errors, logs a message to the console indicating that the connection was successful, and then calls the `afterConnection()` function.

```javascript
function afterConnection() {
  connection.query("SELECT * FROM songs", function(err, res) {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(res);
    connection.end();
  });
}

```

This function queries the `songs` table in the `playlist_db` database, and prints the results to the console. The `query()` method takes an SQL query string and a callback function. The callback function is called once the query has completed, and takes two arguments: an error object and a result object. In this code, the callback function checks for errors, logs the result object to the console, and then closes the connection to the MySQL server using the `end()` method.

```javascript
function searchByGenreOrArtist() {
  var query = connection.query(
    "SELECT * FROM songs WHERE ?? = ?",
    ["genre", "rock"],
    function(err, res) {
      if (err) throw err;
      console.log(res);
      connection.end();
    }
  );
  console.log(query.sql);
}

```

This function demonstrates how to use placeholders in an SQL query to allow for dynamic querying. The `query()` method takes an SQL query string and an array of values to replace the placeholders in the query string. In this code, the placeholders are represented by the question marks (`?`) in the SQL query string, and the values to
***
The code consists of three parts: a MySQL script file named `playlist_db.sql`, a Node.js server file named `playlistReadData.js`, and a package.json file that contains information about the project's dependencies.

The `playlist_db.sql` file contains a script that creates a database called `playlist_db` and creates a table named `songs` with four columns: `id`, `title`, `artist`, and `genre`. The script also inserts some sample data into the table.

The `playlistReadData.js` file contains a Node.js server that connects to the `playlist_db` database and prints all songs in the `songs` table to the console. It also includes a function that prints songs of a specific genre or artist to the console. This function uses placeholders to build a MySQL query that can change dynamically based on the provided arguments.

The `package.json` file contains information about the project's dependencies, which in this case is the MySQL package.

Code snippets:

`playlist_db.sql`

```sql
CREATE DATABASE playlist_db;

USE playlist_db;

CREATE TABLE songs (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  artist VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  genre VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, genre) VALUES ('Song 1', 'Artist 1', 'Rock');
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, genre) VALUES ('Song 2', 'Artist 2', 'Pop');
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, genre) VALUES ('Song 3', 'Artist 3', 'Hip-hop');

```

This code creates a database named `playlist_db`, creates a table named `songs` with four columns, and inserts three rows of data into the table.

`playlistReadData.js`

```javascript
const mysql = require('mysql');

const connection = mysql.createConnection({
  host: 'localhost',
  port: 3306,
  user: 'root',
  password: '',
  database: 'playlist_db',
});

connection.connect((err) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(`Connected as id ${connection.threadId}`);
  readAllSongs();
  readSongsByGenre('Rock');
  readSongsByArtist('Artist 3');
});

const readAllSongs = () => {
  connection.query('SELECT * FROM songs', (err, res) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(res);
  });
};

const readSongsByGenre = (genre) => {
  const query = 'SELECT * FROM songs WHERE genre = ?';
  connection.query(query, [genre], (err, res) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(res);
  });
};

const readSongsByArtist = (artist) => {
  const query = 'SELECT * FROM songs WHERE artist = ?';
  connection.query(query, [artist], (err, res) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(res);
  });
};

```

	This code creates a connection to the `playlist_db` database and defines three functions: `readAllSongs`, `readSongsByGenre`, and `readSongsByArtist`. The `readAllSongs` function selects all songs in the `songs` table and prints them to the console. The `readSongsByGenre` function selects songs with a specific genre and prints them to the console. The `readSongsByArtist` function selects songs with a specific artist and prints them to the console. These functions use placeholders to build dynamic MySQL queries that can change based on the provided arguments.

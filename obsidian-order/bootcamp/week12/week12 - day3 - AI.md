The `animalDBwithSQL.sql` file contains SQL commands to create a database called `animals_db`, create a table called `people`, insert data into it, and update an existing row.

Here's a breakdown of the SQL code:

-   `DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS animals_db;` drops the `animals_db` database if it already exists to avoid conflicts with previous versions of the same database.
-   `CREATE DATABASE animals_db;` creates a new database called `animals_db`.
-   `USE animals_db;` selects the `animals_db` database, so all subsequent commands affect this database.
-   `CREATE TABLE people (...)` creates a new table called `people` in the `animals_db` database. It has the following columns:
    -   `id` is a numeric column that will automatically increment its default value as we create new rows. It is also the primary key of the table, so its values will be unique.
    -   `name` is a string column that cannot contain null values.
    -   `has_pet` is a boolean column that cannot contain null values.
    -   `pet_name` is a string column that can contain null values.
    -   `pet_age` is a numeric column that can contain null values.
-   `INSERT INTO people (...) VALUES (...)` adds new rows to the `people` table. The `VALUES` keyword specifies the values for each column.
-   `UPDATE people SET ... WHERE ...` updates an existing row in the `people` table. The `SET` keyword specifies the new values for each column, and the `WHERE` keyword specifies which row to update.
-   `SELECT * FROM people` displays the contents of the `people` table.

Some key code snippets are:

-   Creating a table with columns:
```sql
CREATE TABLE people (
  id INTEGER(11) AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
  has_pet BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
  pet_name VARCHAR(30),
  pet_age INTEGER(10),
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

```

This code creates a table called `people` with five columns: `id`, `name`, `has_pet`, `pet_name`, and `pet_age`. `id` is a numeric column with auto-incrementing values, and it is set as the primary key. `name` and `has_pet` columns are not nullable, and `pet_name` and `pet_age` can be null.

-   Inserting data into a table:

```sql
INSERT INTO people (name, has_pet, pet_name, pet_age)
VALUES ("Ahmed", true, "Rockington", 100);

```

This code adds a new row to the `people` table with the values "Ahmed" for `name`, `true` for `has_pet`, "Rockington" for `pet_name`, and 100 for `pet_age`.

-   Updating a row in a table:

```sql
UPDATE people
SET has_pet = true, pet_name = "Franklin", pet_age = 2
WHERE id = 4;

```

This code updates the row with an `id` of 4 in the `people` table, setting `has_pet` to `true`, `pet_name` to "Franklin", and `pet_age` to 2. The `WHERE` clause specifies which row to update based on its `id`.

The learning outcomes of this code include understanding how to create a database and table, how to specify column data types and constraints, how to insert data into a table, how to update existing rows in a table, and how to select and display data from a table. Additionally, it demonstrates the use of primary keys to ensure data uniqueness and the use of null values in columns

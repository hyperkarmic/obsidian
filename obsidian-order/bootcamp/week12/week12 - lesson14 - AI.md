This is a task to join two large datasets - a table of top 5000 songs and a table of top 3000 albums. The purpose of joining the two datasets is to find out if a given artist's song and album made it into the charts at the time of their release. Once the datasets are joined, queries are to be made on the new table to find matches of artists with their songs and albums that were in the top charts at the time of their release.

The instruction provides a hint that this can be done in a couple of different ways using external data, but it is suggested to think of methods to use the data within the database to find the correlations. It is also suggested to remember that MySQL has the ability to combine two or more tables together, as long as they share equivalent data.

The schema.sql file provides the SQL schema for the top5000 table in the top_songsDB database. It has columns for position, artist, song, year, and raw totals for the US, UK, Europe, and the rest of the world. It also defines a primary key on the position column.

The top1000songs.csv file provides data for the top 1000 songs of all time. The first 50 rows of data are provided in the file, as the full file is too large to include in the question prompt. Similarly, two other files named top1000albums.csv and top3000songs.csv are also available.

To solve the task, a possible solution is to use the following approach:

1.  Import the top5000, top1000songs, top1000albums, and top3000albums csv files into the top_songsDB database.
2.  Join the top5000 and top1000albums tables using the artist and year columns.
3.  Join the result with the top1000songs table using the artist and song columns.
4.  Join the result with the top3000albums table using the artist and album columns.
5.  Create a new table that contains the joined data, with columns for position, artist, song, album, year, raw_total, raw_usa, raw_uk, raw_eur, and raw_row.
6.  Query the new table to find matches of a given artist with their songs and albums that were in the top charts at the time of their release.

Here's the JavaScript code to perform the above steps:

```javascript
const csv = require('csv-parser');
const fs = require('fs');
const mysql = require('mysql');

// create a connection to the database
const connection = mysql.createConnection({
  host: 'localhost',
  user: 'root',
  password: 'password',
  database: 'top_songsDB'
});

// import the top5000, top1000songs, top1000albums, and top3000albums csv files into the top_songsDB database
const importCsvDataToDatabase = (csvFile, tableName) => {
  const results = [];

  fs.createReadStream(csvFile)
    .pipe(csv())
    .on('data', (data) => results.push(data))
    .on('end', () => {
      connection.query(`DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ${tableName}`, (err, result) => {
        if (err) throw err;
        console.log(`Table ${tableName} dropped`);
      });

      const columns = Object.keys(results[0]);
      const createTableSql = `CREATE TABLE ${tableName} (${columns.map(column => `${column} VARCHAR(255)`).join(', ')})`;

      connection.query(createTableSql, (err, result) => {
        if (err) throw err;
        console.log(`Table ${tableName} created`);

        results.forEach((row) => {
          const insertSql = `INSERT INTO

```

To solve this problem, you need to merge the top 5000 songs and top 3000 albums data and make it into one table. You are then expected to write a function that will take an artist's name and output all the entries that match the artist from the merged table.

To begin, you can create a database with the name "top_songsDB" and a table named "top5000". The "top5000" table will have columns such as "position", "artist", "song", "year", "raw_total", "raw_usa", "raw_uk", "raw_eur", and "raw_row". These columns will represent the position, artist name, song name, release year, and raw scores of the song's ranking in the top charts of different regions.

After creating the table, you can import data into the table from the "top1000songs.csv" file. However, the data is very large, so only 50 entries have been provided in the file. Similarly, the data in the top3000albums.csv and top_spotify_songs.csv files have been greatly reduced.

Once the data has been imported into the table, you can merge it with the data from the "top3000albums.csv" file to create a new table that includes data on the top albums and top songs.

Finally, you can write a function that takes an artist's name as input and outputs all the entries that match the artist from the merged table.

Here is the complete code to accomplish this:

```javascript
const mysql = require('mysql');

//Create Connection
const connection = mysql.createConnection({
    host     : 'localhost',
    user     : 'your_username',
    password : 'your_password',
    database : 'top_songsDB'
});

//Connect to MySQL
connection.connect((err) => {
    if(err) throw err;
    console.log('MySQL Connected...');
});

//Import data from csv
const csv = require('csv-parser');
const fs = require('fs');

const readStream = fs.createReadStream('top1000songs.csv');
readStream.pipe(csv())
.on('data', (row) => {
    connection.query('INSERT INTO top5000 SET ?', row, (error, results, fields) => {
        if (error) throw error;
    });
})
.on('end', () => {
    console.log('CSV file successfully processed');
});

//Import data from csv
const readStream2 = fs.createReadStream('top3000albums.csv');
readStream2.pipe(csv())
.on('data', (row) => {
    connection.query('INSERT INTO top5000 SET ?', row, (error, results, fields) => {
        if (error) throw error;
    });
})
.on('end', () => {
    console.log('CSV file successfully processed');
});

//Merge top5000 and top3000albums tables
const mergeTableQuery = `CREATE TABLE top_songs_albums AS
                        SELECT position, artist, song, year, raw_total, raw_usa, raw_uk, raw_eur, raw_row
                        FROM top5000
                        UNION
                        SELECT position as album_position, artist as album_artist, album, year as album_year, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL
                        FROM top3000albums`;

connection.query(mergeTableQuery, (error, results, fields) => {
    if (error) throw error;
    console.log('Tables merged successfully');
});

//Query the new table to get all matches for an artist
function getMatches(artist) {
    const query = `SELECT * FROM top_songs_albums WHERE artist = '${artist}'`;
    connection.query(query, (error, results, fields) =>

```

The task is to join two tables of top songs and albums by a given artist to see if their song and album made it to the charts at the time of release. The provided SQL schema creates a table `top5000` with columns for position, artist, song, year, and rankings by location. The given data files include `top1000songs.csv`, `top3000albums.csv`, and `top100spotify.csv`, which list the top 1000 songs, top 3000 albums, and top 100 Spotify songs, respectively, with rankings by location, artist, song, year, and other metadata. Given the artist name, the program should output the matches from the joined table, which includes the year, album position, artist, song, and album name.

To solve this problem, we will create two tables, `top5000` and `top3000albums`, in MySQL using the schema. We will then read the `top1000songs.csv` and `top3000albums.csv` files into Node.js using the `csv-parser` library and insert the data into the respective tables using the `mysql` library. Once we have both tables populated, we will join them using an SQL query and look for matches by artist name. We will then output the matches found.

Code snippets:

1.  Creating a table in MySQL using the provided schema.sql file:

```sql
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS top_songsDB;
CREATE database top_songsDB;

USE top_songsDB;

CREATE TABLE top5000 (
  position INT NOT NULL,
  artist VARCHAR(100) NULL,
  song VARCHAR(100) NULL,
  year INT NULL,
  raw_total DECIMAL(10,4) NULL,
  raw_usa DECIMAL(10,4) NULL,
  raw_uk DECIMAL(10,4) NULL,
  raw_eur DECIMAL(10,4) NULL,
  raw_row DECIMAL(10,4) NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (position)
);

```
2.  Reading and inserting data from `top1000songs.csv` into MySQL using the `csv-parser` and `mysql` libraries:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const csv = require('csv-parser');
const mysql = require('mysql');

const connection = mysql.createConnection({
  host: 'localhost',
  user: 'root',
  password: 'password',
  database: 'top_songsDB'
});

fs.createReadStream('top1000songs.csv')
  .pipe(csv())
  .on('data', (row) => {
    const { Position, Artist, Song, Year, Raw_total, Raw_USA, Raw_UK, Raw_EUR, Raw_ROW } = row;

    const values = [Position, Artist, Song, Year, Raw_total, Raw_USA, Raw_UK, Raw_EUR, Raw_ROW];

    connection.query('INSERT INTO top5000 (position, artist, song, year, raw_total, raw_usa, raw_uk, raw_eur, raw_row) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)', values, (err, result) => {
      if (err) throw err;
      console.log(result);
    });
  })
  .on('end', () => {
    console.log('CSV file successfully processed');
  });

```

The task requires joining two large datasets - "top 5000 songs" and "top 3000 albums" in order to find out if a given artist's song and album made it into the charts at the time of their release. The schema.sql file contains a SQL script that creates a new database named "top_songsDB" and a table named "top5000" with columns "position", "artist", "song", "year", "raw_total", "raw_usa", "raw_uk", "raw_eur", and "raw_row".

There are three provided CSV files containing the data:

1.  top5000.csv - The top 5000 songs.
2.  top3000_albums.csv - The top 3000 albums.
3.  top1000songs.csv - The top 1000 songs.

The main task is to join the "top5000" and "top3000_albums" tables in order to identify songs that have been released on albums that have made it to the charts. This can be achieved using SQL join queries. The expected output is to find all the matches of the given artist's song and album that made it into the charts at the time of their release.

As the files contain huge data, the task requires to filter out the required entries to execute the queries. The "top1000songs.csv" contains only the top 1000 songs, so it can be used for testing the queries.

The following JavaScript code can be used to create a database, import the CSV files data into the tables, and execute the SQL join query to identify the matches:

```javascript
const mysql = require('mysql');
const fs = require('fs');
const csv = require('fast-csv');

const connection = mysql.createConnection({
  host: 'localhost',
  user: 'root',
  password: 'password',
  database: 'top_songsDB'
});

// create top5000 table
const createTop5000Table = () => {
  const createQuery = `
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS top5000 (
      position INT NOT NULL,
      artist VARCHAR(100) NULL,
      song VARCHAR(100) NULL,
      year INT NULL,
      raw_total DECIMAL(10,4) NULL,
      raw_usa DECIMAL(10,4) NULL,
      raw_uk DECIMAL(10,4) NULL,
      raw_eur DECIMAL(10,4) NULL,
      raw_row DECIMAL(10,4) NULL,
      PRIMARY KEY (position)
    )
  `;
  connection.query(createQuery, (error, results, fields) => {
    if (error) throw error;
    console.log('Top5000 table created successfully!');
  });
}

// create top3000_albums table
const createTop3000AlbumsTable = () => {
  const createQuery = `
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS top3000_albums (
      position INT NOT NULL,
      artist VARCHAR(100) NULL,
      album VARCHAR(100) NULL,
      year INT NULL,
      PRIMARY KEY (position)
    )
  `;
  connection.query(createQuery, (error, results, fields) => {
    if (error) throw error;
    console.log('Top3000_albums table created successfully!');
  });
}

// import data from top5000.csv to top5000 table
const importTop5000Data = () => {
  let stream = fs.createReadStream('top5000.csv');
  let csvData = [];
  let csvStream = csv
    .parse()
    .on("data", function (data) {
      csvData.push(data);
    })
    .on("end", function () {
      // remove header
      csvData

```

To complete this task, we need to merge two tables, top5000 and top3000, into a new table that we can perform queries on. We also need to find matches between the two tables based on artists, songs, and albums.

The top5000 table contains data on the top 5000 songs of all time, while the top3000 table contains data on the top 3000 albums of all time. We need to merge these two tables based on the artist, song, and album data.

We will write JavaScript code that accomplishes the following:

1.  Create a MySQL database called top_songsDB.
2.  Create a table called top5000 in the top_songsDB database with columns position, artist, song, year, raw_total, raw_usa, raw_uk, raw_eur, raw_row, and set position as the primary key.
3.  Import data from the top1000songs.csv file into the top5000 table.
4.  Create a table called top3000 in the top_songsDB database with columns position, artist, album, year, and set position as the primary key.
5.  Import data from the top3000albums.csv file into the top3000 table.
6.  Create a new table called top_albums_songs with columns year, album_position, artist, song, album.
7.  Join the top5000 and top3000 tables on the artist and album columns.
8.  For each matching row, insert the year, album_position, artist, song, and album data into the top_albums_songs table.
9.  Write a function that takes an artist name as input and returns all matching rows from the top_albums_songs table with the number of matches found.

Let's start by creating the top_songsDB database and the top5000 table using the following code snippet:

```javascript
const mysql = require('mysql');

const connection = mysql.createConnection({
  host: 'localhost',
  user: 'root',
  password: '',
});

connection.connect((err) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('Connected!');
  connection.query('CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS top_songsDB', (err, result) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log('Database created!');
  });
});

connection.query('USE top_songsDB', (err) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('Using top_songsDB database');
});

connection.query(`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS top5000 (
    position INT NOT NULL,
    artist VARCHAR(100) NULL,
    song VARCHAR(100) NULL,
    year INT NULL,
    raw_total DECIMAL(10,4) NULL,
    raw_usa DECIMAL(10,4) NULL,
    raw_uk DECIMAL(10,4) NULL,
    raw_eur DECIMAL(10,4) NULL,
    raw_row DECIMAL(10,4) NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (position)
  );`, (err, result) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('Table top5000 created!');
  connection.end();
});

```

This code will create a MySQL connection and create a top_songsDB database, and then create a top5000 table in the database with columns position, artist, song, year, raw_total, raw_usa, raw_uk, raw_eur, and raw_row, with position as the primary key.

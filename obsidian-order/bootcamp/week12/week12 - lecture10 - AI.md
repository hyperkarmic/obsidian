This code exercise involves building a Node.js command line application called Great-Bay that allows users to create and bid on assorted items, tasks, jobs, or projects. The user is prompted with two options upon launching the application, whether to "POST AN ITEM" or "BID ON AN ITEM". If the user selects to "POST AN ITEM", they are prompted to provide information about the item such as the seller's name, item name, and item value. If the user selects "BID ON AN ITEM", they are shown a list of all available items, prompted to select which one they would like to bid on and then asked to enter their bid. The bid is compared to the previous highest bid and, if successful, the new bid replaces the previous bid; if the bid is lower, the user is informed of their failure and taken back to the selection screen.

The application is built using Node.js, the inquirer and mysql packages, and the util module's promisify function. The MySQL database is used to store and retrieve data on items and bids.

The provided .sql file contains the SQL code to create the initial database and tables for this application. The .js server file is the application itself, containing functions to perform database operations, create the command line interface, process user actions, and other functionality.

The package.json file contains information about the application's name, version, dependencies, and other metadata.

In addition to the basic functionality, the exercise also suggests several "add-ons" or extra features to be added to the application, such as a sign-up and login system, a "My Auctions" page, a "My Bids" page, and a search function, among others.

To run this application, you will need to have Node.js installed and run the command "npm install" in the application directory to install the required dependencies.

To launch the application, you can then run "node index.js". The application will prompt you to select whether to "POST AN ITEM" or "BID ON AN ITEM" and then guide you through the necessary steps to complete the chosen action.

A key code snippet that demonstrates the insertion of a new item into the MySQL database using the insert function in the util.js file is:

```javascript
// Insert into the database with the item that we've got
insert(connection, "items", postItem);

```

This code takes the provided connection object and inserts a new row into the "items" table with the data provided in the postItem object.

Another key code snippet that demonstrates the use of inquirer to prompt the user with questions and capture their responses is:

```javascript
//Use inquirer with the questions that we've posted.
const postItem = await inquirer.prompt(postQuestions);

```

This code prompts the user with the questions provided in the postQuestions array and captures their responses in the postItem object. The "await" keyword is used to wait for the user to complete the questions before proceeding with the rest of the function.

The given code is a SQL script that creates a database called "programming_db" and a table named "programming_languages" within the database. It also inserts some data into the table and provides instructions to modify the data using the id column. Additionally, the script includes bonus tasks related to adding a new column to the table and learning about SQL joins.

The first line of the script drops the "programming_db" database if it already exists. This is done to ensure that any existing database with the same name is removed before creating a new one.

The next line creates a new database called "programming_db" using the CREATE DATABASE statement.

The script then switches to the newly created "programming_db" database and creates a new table called "programming_languages". This table has four columns:

-   "id": a numeric column that will automatically increment its default value as new rows are created. This column is also set as the table's primary key.
-   "language": a string column that will store the name of the programming language.
-   "rating": an integer column that will store a rating value for the programming language.
-   "mastered": a boolean column that will automatically fill with "true" when a new row is made and the value isn't otherwise defined. This column will be used to indicate whether a user has mastered a programming language.

After creating the table, the script provides instructions to insert some example data into the table using the INSERT INTO statement.

Finally, the script includes two bonus tasks. The first task involves adding a new column to the table. Specifically, a boolean column called "mastered" is to be added to the table with a default value of true. This is done using the ALTER TABLE statement.

The second bonus task involves learning about SQL joins. No specific code is provided for this task, but the user is encouraged to start looking into the concept of joins in SQL.

Here is the modified code with the necessary SQL statements to complete the task:

```sql
-- Drops the programming_db if it already exists --
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS programming_db;
-- Create a database called programming_db --
CREATE DATABASE programming_db;

-- Use programming db for the following statements --
USE programming_db;

CREATE TABLE programming_languages(
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  language VARCHAR(50),
  rating INT,
  mastered BOOLEAN DEFAULT true
);

-- Insert example rows --
INSERT INTO programming_languages (language, rating) VALUES
('Python', 9),
('Java', 8),
('JavaScript', 7);

-- Modify data using id column --
UPDATE programming_languages SET rating = 10 WHERE id = 1;

-- BONUS: Add a new boolean column to the table --
ALTER TABLE programming_languages ADD mastered BOOLEAN DEFAULT true;

-- BONUS: Start looking into the concept of joins in SQL --
-- No specific code provided. --

```

The code creates a new database called "programming_db" and switches to it. It creates a new table called "programming_languages" with four columns. It then inserts three rows of example data into the table.

To modify the data using the id column, an UPDATE statement is used. In this example, the rating value for the row with an id of 1 is changed to 10.

To complete the first bonus task, an ALTER TABLE statement is used to add a new column called "mastered" to the table with a default value of true.

No specific code is provided for the second bonus task, but the user is encouraged to start looking into the concept of SQL joins.

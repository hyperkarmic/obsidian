This code exercise aims to demonstrate Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) with MySQL in a Node.js/Express application. The purpose of the application is to store and retrieve user-generated messages or chirps. The project consists of a MySQL database, an Express.js server, and a basic front-end user interface. The server creates an API endpoint that can receive HTTP requests for creating, retrieving, and deleting chirps in the database.

The following files and folders are included in this exercise:

1.  `app/schema.sql`: This file contains SQL commands that create the database and the chirps table. It also includes sample data.
    
2.  `app/readme.md`: This file provides instructions for setting up the database.
    
3.  `app/package.json`: This file contains metadata about the application, as well as a list of dependencies required to run it.
    
4.  `app/server.js`: This file sets up an Express.js server that listens for HTTP requests on a specified port. It also loads the `api-routes.js` file, and connects to the MySQL database using the `connection.js` file.
    
5.  `app/config/connection.js`: This file contains a MySQL connection object that is used to connect to the database. The `mysql` npm package is used to create this connection.
    
6.  `app/routes/api-routes.js`: This file contains the API endpoints for creating, retrieving, and deleting chirps.
    
7.  `app/public/index.html`: This file contains a basic front-end interface for creating and displaying chirps.
    
8.  `app/public/css/style.css`: This file contains some basic CSS styling for the front-end interface.
    
9.  `app/public/js/chirp.js`: This file contains JavaScript code that uses jQuery to make API requests to the server and update the front-end interface with chirps.
    

To run the application, the following steps should be taken:

1.  Create a MySQL database called `chirpy` by running the SQL commands in `app/schema.sql`.
    
2.  Install the dependencies by running `npm install` in the project directory.
    
3.  Start the server by running `node app/server.js` in the project directory.
    
4.  Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to use the front-end interface.
    

The learning outcomes of this exercise include:

1.  Understanding how to set up a MySQL database and create tables using SQL commands.
    
2.  Understanding how to use the `mysql` npm package to create a MySQL connection object in a Node.js application.
    
3.  Understanding how to use Express.js to create API endpoints for handling HTTP requests.
    
4.  Understanding how to use jQuery to make API requests to the server and update the front-end interface with data.
    
***
The exercise involves developing a simple web application that uses the ORM (Object Relational Mapping) technique to interact with a MySQL database. The application is a Twitter clone that allows users to create and view 'chirps'. The technology stack used in the application includes Express.js for the server, MySQL as the database, and Bootstrap for the front-end styling.

The exercise comprises several files including:

-   `server.js`: This file is the main entry point for the application. It creates an instance of an Express.js server and sets up middleware for handling requests and serving static files.
-   `api-routes.js`: This file contains the routing logic for handling API requests. It defines HTTP endpoints for creating and fetching chirps.
-   `connection.js`: This file contains the configuration for connecting to the MySQL database.
-   `schema.sql`: This file contains the SQL statements for creating the `chirpy` database and the `chirps` table.
-   `package.json`: This file contains metadata about the application, including its dependencies.
-   `readme.md`: This file contains instructions for setting up and running the application.
-   `/public` folder: This folder contains static files that are served by the server. It includes an `index.html` file that contains the HTML structure of the application, a `style.css` file that contains the styles for the application, and a `chirp.js` file that contains the client-side JavaScript code for handling chirp creation and fetching.

Learning Outcomes:

This exercise teaches developers how to use the ORM technique to interact with a database using Node.js and Express.js. Specifically, developers will learn how to:

-   Set up a MySQL database and create a table using SQL statements.
-   Configure a Node.js application to connect to a MySQL database.
-   Define HTTP endpoints for handling API requests using Express.js.
-   Use an ORM library (in this case, the `mysql` library) to interact with the database.
-   Serve static files using middleware in Express.js.
-   Use client-side JavaScript to send HTTP requests and receive responses from the server.

Code Snippets:

1.  Creating a MySQL database and table using SQL statements:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE chirpy;

USE chirpy;

CREATE TABLE chirps (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
  author VARCHAR(30),
  chirp VARCHAR(30),
  time_created CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
);

INSERT INTO chirps (author, chirp) VALUES 
  ('chris', 'cookies'), 
  ('adnan', 'pizzapie');

```

2.  Setting up a connection to a MySQL database using the `mysql` library:

```javascript
const mysql = require('mysql');

const dbOptions = {
  host: 'localhost',
  port: 3306,
  user: 'root',
  password: 'password',
  database: 'chirpy'
};

const connection = mysql.createConnection(dbOptions);

const onConnect = (err) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('Successfully connected to the DB');
};

connection.connect(onConnect);

module.exports = connection;

```

3.  Defining HTTP endpoints for handling chirp creation and fetching using Express.js:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const chirpOrm = require('../orm/chirpOrm');

const router = express.Router();

router.get('/api/chirps', (req, res) => {
  chirpOrm.selectAll((err, data) => {
    if (err) {
      console.log(err);
      return res.sendStatus(500);
    }
    res.json(data);
  });
});

router.post('/api/chirps', (req, res) => {
  chirpOrm.insertOne(req.body, (err, data) => {
   

```

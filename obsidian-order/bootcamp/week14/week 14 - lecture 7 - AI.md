The code exercise is focused on understanding Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) using Sequelize, which is a powerful ORM for Node.js. The main goal is to create a `Todo` model with two columns (`text` and `complete`) and sync the model with a local MySQL database using Sequelize. The project structure consists of an `Unsolved` folder, which contains a `server.js` file, a `config` folder, a `public` folder, and a `routes` folder. The `server.js` file is the main entry point of the application, and it requires the `models` folder, which contains the `Todo` model. The `config` folder has the `config.json` file, which stores the database credentials. The `public` folder contains the `index.html` file, along with the `css` and `js` folders, which contain the styling and front-end logic of the application. The `routes` folder has the `api-routes.js` file, which contains the server-side logic of the application.

Code Explanation:

1.  Creating a new local MYSQL database called 'todolist', but don't create any tables.

```SQL
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS todolist;

```

2.  Deleting any references to the `orm.js` file inside the `api-routes.js` file.

```javascript
// Remove orm import statement
const db = require('../models');

```

3.  Deleting the `config` folder.

```javascript
// Delete the config folder.

```

4.  Installing dependencies using `npm install` in the terminal.

```javascript
npm install

```

5.  Initializing Sequelize models and configuration files.

```javascript
sequelize init:models & sequelize init:config

```

6.  Modifying the `config.json` file to match your MySQL database credentials.

```javascript
{
  "development": {
    "username": "<your-username>",
    "password": "<your-password>",
    "database": "todolist",
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 3306,
    "dialect": "mysql",
    "operatorsAliases": false
  },
  "test": {
    ...
  },
  "production": {
    ...
  }
}

```

7.  Creating a new file called `todo.js` inside the `models` folder to define the `Todo` model.

```javascript
module.exports = function(sequelize, DataTypes) {
  const Todo = sequelize.define("Todo", {
    text: DataTypes.STRING,
    complete: DataTypes.BOOLEAN
  });
  return Todo;
};

```

8.  Requiring all of our models by requiring the `models` folder in the `server.js` file.

```javascript
const db = require('./models');


```

9.  Syncing the models by running `db.sequelize.sync()` before starting the express server.

```javascript
db.sequelize.sync().then(function() {
  app.listen(PORT, function() {
    console.log(`App listening on PORT ${PORT}`);
  });
});

```

10.  Running the application using `node server.js` and checking if the `Todos` table was created in MySQL Workbench.

```javascript
node server.js

```

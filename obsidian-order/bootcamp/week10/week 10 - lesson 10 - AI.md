This is a code exercise to implement functionality for a given `Algo` constructor. The code files include `algo.js`, `algo.test.js`, `index.js`, `package.json`, and `readme.md`.

`algo.js` is a JavaScript file containing the `Algo` constructor with three methods - `reverse`, `isPalindrome`, and `capitalize`. `algo.test.js` is a test file for the three methods. `index.js` is a JavaScript file used to run and test the implemented code. `package.json` contains the name, version, description, author, and license of the project, as well as the Jest package dependency, which is a popular testing framework for JavaScript.

The task is to write code to implement the three methods in `algo.js`, starting with the `reverse` method, so that the tests in `algo.test.js` pass. Once each method has been implemented, the `npm run test` command is run in the terminal to verify that the method is correctly implemented before moving on to the next one.

The `reverse` method takes a string as input and returns the reversed version of the string. The `isPalindrome` method takes a string as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the string is a palindrome. The `capitalize` method takes a string as input and returns a new string with the first letter of each word capitalized.

The learning outcomes of this exercise are to practice test-driven development (TDD), which is an approach to software development where tests are written first and then code is written to pass the tests. It also provides an opportunity to practice implementing JavaScript functions that manipulate strings and arrays.

Here's a key code snippet from `algo.js` that implements the `reverse` method:

```javascript
reverse(str) {
  return str.split("").reverse().join("");
}

```

This method takes a string `str`, splits it into an array of characters using the `split` method, reverses the order of the array using the `reverse` method, and then joins the characters back together into a string using the `join` method. The resulting string is the reversed version of the input string.

Another key code snippet from `algo.js` that implements the `isPalindrome` method:

```javascript
isPalindrome(str) {
  const reversed = str.split("").reverse().join("");
  return str === reversed;
}

```

This method takes a string `str`, reverses it using the same approach as the `reverse` method, and then compares the reversed string to the original string. If the reversed string is the same as the original string, then the original string is a palindrome and the method returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

And finally, a key code snippet from `algo.js` that implements the `capitalize` method:

```javascript
capitalize(str) {
  return str.split(" ").map(word => word.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + word.slice(1)).join(" ");
}

```

This method takes a string `str`, splits it into an array of words using the `split` method, uses the `map` method to transform each word in the array, and then joins the words back together into a string using the `join` method. The transformation applied to each word is to capitalize the first letter of the word using the `charAt` and `toUpperCase` methods, and then concatenate the rest of the word using the `slice` method.

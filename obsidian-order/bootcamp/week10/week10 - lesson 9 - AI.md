This exercise is focused on Test Driven Development (TDD), where developers write tests for their code before writing the actual code. The provided code contains an empty `Algo` constructor function with three empty methods: `reverse`, `isPalindrome`, and `capitalize`. The objective is to write tests for each method inside the `algo.test.js` file and verify that each method is working as expected.

Learning Outcomes:

-   Understanding the Test Driven Development (TDD) methodology
-   Writing tests using the Jest testing framework
-   Implementing functions to meet the requirements set by the tests

Code Explanation:

`algo.js` file exports a constructor function named `Algo`. This function has three empty methods: `reverse`, `isPalindrome`, and `capitalize`. These methods are meant to be implemented later by the developer.

`algo.test.js` file uses the Jest testing framework to test the methods in `Algo`. The first `describe` block is for the `reverse` method. The test `it` block inside the `describe` block checks whether the `reverse` method is properly reversing the string that is passed as an argument.

The second `describe` block is for the `isPalindrome` method. It contains two test `it` blocks, one to test whether the `isPalindrome` method is returning `true` when a palindrome string is passed as an argument, and another to test whether the method is returning `false` when a non-palindrome string is passed as an argument.

The third `describe` block is for the `capitalize` method. The test `it` block inside the `describe` block checks whether the `capitalize` method is properly capitalizing the first letter of each word in the string that is passed as an argument.

By running the tests in `algo.test.js`, developers can ensure that their code is functioning as expected.

=====================================================
The provided code consists of a constructor function named Algo, which has three empty methods named reverse, isPalindrome, and capitalize. The goal of this exercise is to write test cases for each of these three methods that will test their functionality.

The test cases are written in the algo.test.js file located inside the test folder. The test cases will test the methods of the Algo constructor function.

Learning outcomes:

1.  Understanding Test Driven Development (TDD): The exercise provides a good introduction to Test Driven Development (TDD). TDD is a software development practice in which developers write automated test cases before writing the actual code. This approach helps developers to write more reliable and maintainable code.
    
2.  Writing Unit Tests: The exercise provides an opportunity to practice writing unit tests. Unit tests are automated tests that are written to test individual components or functions of an application. By writing unit tests, developers can ensure that the individual components of their application are working as expected.
    

Code Explanation:

1.  The `Algo` constructor function has three empty methods: `reverse`, `isPalindrome`, and `capitalize`. These methods are currently empty, and we need to write test cases to define how these methods should work.
    
2.  The `test` folder contains a file named `algo.test.js` which contains the test cases for each method of the `Algo` constructor function.
    
3.  The `describe` function is used to group related test cases together. In this case, each method of the `Algo` constructor function has its own `describe` block.
    
4.  The `it` function is used to define individual test cases. Each `it` block contains a description of what the test is testing and the actual test case.
    
5.  The `expect` function is used to define the expected output of the test case.
    
6.  Each test case is run using the `npm test` command, and the output is displayed in the terminal. If a test fails, an error message is displayed with details about what went wrong.

algos.js - completed

```javascript
function Algo() {}

Algo.prototype.reverse = function(str) {
  return str.split("").reverse().join("");
};

Algo.prototype.isPalindrome = function(str) {
  const reversed = this.reverse(str);
  return str === reversed;
};

Algo.prototype.capitalize = function(str) {
  return str
    .split(" ")
    .map(word => word.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + word.slice(1))
    .join(" ");
};

module.exports = Algo;

```

Explanation:

The `Algo` constructor function defines three methods: `reverse`, `isPalindrome`, and `capitalize`. Each method is added to the `prototype` object of the `Algo` function so that it can be shared across all instances of the object.

The `reverse` method takes a string as an argument, splits it into an array of characters using the `split()` method, reverses the order of the characters using the `reverse()` method, and then joins the characters back into a string using the `join()` method. The reversed string is then returned.

The `isPalindrome` method takes a string as an argument and uses the `reverse()` method to create a reversed version of the string. It then compares the original string to the reversed string and returns `true` if they are the same, indicating that the original string is a palindrome. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

The `capitalize` method takes a string as an argument, splits it into an array of words using the `split()` method, capitalizes the first letter of each word using the `charAt()` and `toUpperCase()` methods, and then joins the words back into a string using the `join()` method. The capitalized string is then returned.

The `module.exports` statement at the end of the file exports the `Algo` object so that it can be used in other files.

The `algos.test.js` file contains tests for each of these methods, which check that they produce the expected output when given certain inputs. These tests are used to guide the development of the `algos.js` file, ensuring that the code works correctly and behaves as intended.

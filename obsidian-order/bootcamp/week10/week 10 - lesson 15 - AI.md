This code appears to be a demonstration of using asynchronous JavaScript to search for movie information using the OMDB API.

The package.json file lists the dependencies for the project, including Jest for testing and Axios for making HTTP requests to the API.

The index.js file requires the MovieSearch module and creates a new instance of it. It then calls the search method on the movie object, passing in "Spider-Man" as the search term. When the search completes, the results are logged to the console.

The movieSearch.js file exports a MovieSearch class with a search method that makes an HTTP request to the OMDB API using the Axios library. The buildUrl method constructs the API endpoint URL with the provided movie name and an API key.

The movieSearch.test.js file contains Jest tests for the MovieSearch class. The first test checks that the buildUrl method returns the expected API endpoint URL. The second test checks that the search method correctly calls the Axios get method with the constructed URL and resolves with the expected data object.

The learning outcomes from this code include:

-   Understanding how to make asynchronous HTTP requests using Axios
-   Understanding how to use Jest to test asynchronous code
-   Understanding how to use Jest's mock functionality to test code that makes HTTP requests
-   Understanding how to structure code using classes and modules to make it more modular and reusable.

Some key code snippets to understand this code include:
```javascript
  axios.get(url)
```
-   `axios.get(url)` to make an HTTP GET request to the provided URL using Axios
```javascript
jest.mock("axios")
```
-   `jest.mock("axios")` to mock the Axios library for testing purposes
```javascript
 expect(...).resolves.toEqual(...)
```
-   `expect(...).resolves.toEqual(...)` to test that an asynchronous function resolves with the expected value
```javascript
module.exports = MovieSearch
```
-   `module.exports = MovieSearch` to export the MovieSearch class from the module for use in other files.

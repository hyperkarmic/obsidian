The `readme.md` file provides instructions for extending the basic `Vehicle` class to create `Car` and `Boat` subclasses with additional properties and methods.

In `vehicle.js`, we have the basic `Vehicle` class with its constructor and `printInfo` method.

To create a `Car` subclass, we can extend the `Vehicle` class and add the necessary properties and methods. Here is an example of how to do that:

```javascript
class Car extends Vehicle {
  constructor(id, numberOfWheels, sound, color, passengers) {
    super(id, numberOfWheels, sound);
    this.color = color;
    this.passengers = passengers;
  }

  checkPassengers() {
    if (this.passengers.length > 4) {
      console.log("There are too many passengers.");
    }
  }

  useHorn() {
    console.log(this.sound);
  }
}

```

This creates a `Car` class that inherits from `Vehicle`, and adds a `color` property, `passengers` property, `checkPassengers()` method that logs a message if there are too many passengers, and a `useHorn()` method that logs the car's sound.

Similarly, we can create a `Boat` subclass with a `crew` property and methods to check the crew and use the boat's horn:

```javascript
class Boat extends Vehicle {
  constructor(id, numberOfWheels, sound, crew) {
    super(id, numberOfWheels, sound);
    this.crew = crew;
  }

  crewSoundOff() {
    console.log("Crew sound off!");
    this.crew.forEach(member => {
      console.log(member);
    });
  }

  useHorn() {
    console.log(this.sound);
  }
}

```

This creates a `Boat` class that inherits from `Vehicle`, and adds a `crew` property, `crewSoundOff()` method to print each member of the crew to the console, and a `useHorn()` method to log the boat's sound.

To use these subclasses, we would need to create new instances of `Car` and `Boat` and call their methods as necessary. Here is an example:

```javascript
const myCar = new Car(1, 4, "honk", "red", ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]);
myCar.printInfo(); // This vehicle has 4 wheels / This vehicle has an id of 1
myCar.checkPassengers(); // No output
myCar.useHorn(); // "honk"

const myBoat = new Boat(2, 0, "foghorn", ["Captain", "First Mate", "Cook"]);
myBoat.printInfo(); // This vehicle has 0 wheels / This vehicle has an id of 2
myBoat.crewSoundOff(); // Crew sound off! / Captain / First Mate / Cook
myBoat.useHorn(); // "foghorn"

```

The learning outcomes of this exercise include:

-   Understanding how to extend a class to create a subclass.
-   Knowing how to call the superclass's constructor using `super()`.
-   Understanding how to add properties and methods to a subclass.
-   Knowing how to create new instances of a subclass and call their methods.

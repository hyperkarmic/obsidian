This exercise is focused on testing and mocking the file system module (fs) in Node.js using Jest. It consists of three files: `fileIO.js` which exports a constructor function `FileIO` with methods to read, write and append to files; `index.js` which creates an instance of `FileIO` and calls its methods to write, read and append a message to a file; and `fileIO.test.js` which contains the Jest test suite.

The objective of the test suite is to ensure that the `FileIO` methods are called with the correct arguments, that `fs.readFileSync`, `fs.writeFileSync`, and `fs.appendFileSync` are mocked, and that they are called with the correct arguments.

The `package.json` file contains a reference to the `jest` package, which is a development dependency.

Learning outcomes:

1.  Writing tests for Node.js modules using Jest
2.  Mocking the file system module `fs`
3.  Using Jest's `mockReturnValue` and `lastCalledWith` methods to test if methods are called with the correct arguments.

Code Explanation:

In the `fileIO.js` file, the `FileIO` constructor exports methods to read, write and append files using the synchronous methods of `fs` module.

In the `index.js` file, an instance of the `FileIO` constructor is created and its methods `write`, `read` and `append` are called to write, read and append a message to a file named `message.txt`.

The `fileIO.test.js` file contains the Jest test suite, where `fs` is mocked, and its methods `readFileSync`, `writeFileSync`, and `appendFileSync` are overridden using `jest.mock('fs')`. Then, for each of the three methods in `FileIO`, a test is written to check if the mocked `fs` methods are called with the correct arguments.

The `message.txt` file contains a message that is used to test the read and append methods.

Key code snippets:

1.  Mocking `fs` module in the `fileIO.test.js` file

```javascript
jest.mock('fs');

```

2.  Using `mockReturnValue` to set a return value for `fs.readFileSync` method in the `read` test

```javascript
fs.readFileSync.mockReturnValue("Hello World!");

```

3.  Using `lastCalledWith` to check if `fs.readFileSync` is called with the correct arguments

```javascript
expect(fs.readFileSync).lastCalledWith(file, "utf8");

```

4.  Using `lastCalledWith` to check if `fs.writeFileSync` is called with the correct arguments

```javascript
expect(fs.writeFileSync).lastCalledWith(path, data);

```

5.  Using `lastCalledWith` to check if `fs.appendFileSync` is called with the correct arguments

```javascript
expect(fs.appendFileSync).lastCalledWith(file, data);

```

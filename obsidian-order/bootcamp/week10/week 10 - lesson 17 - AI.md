This is a Node.js module that defines a TV object constructor with two methods: `findActor` and `findShow`.

The `findActor` method searches for a TV show actor by making a GET request to the TVMaze API using the `axios` library. It takes an actor name as a parameter and constructs a URL with that name. When the response is received, it extracts the relevant information from the response data and formats it as a string. Then, it passes that string to a function called `appendDataToFile` which appends the data to a file.

The `findShow` method searches for a TV show by making a similar GET request to the TVMaze API. It takes a show name as a parameter and constructs a URL with that name. When the response is received, it extracts the relevant information from the response data and formats it as a string. Then, it passes that string to the `appendDataToFile` function which appends the data to a file.

The `appendDataToFile` function is imported from a separate module called `file.js` and is responsible for appending data to a file. It is not defined in this module.

Finally, the `TV` object constructor is exported from this module so that it can be used by other parts of the application.

***
This is a Node.js module that exports a constructor function called `TV`. The `TV` constructor has two methods, `findActor` and `findShow`, which use the `axios` library to make HTTP requests to the TVMaze API and then process the response data and write it to a file using the `appendDataToFile` function.

The `findActor` method takes an `actor` parameter, which is used to search for actors using the TVMaze API. The method constructs a URL using the `actor` parameter and then makes an HTTP GET request to the URL using `axios`. When the response is received, the `processActorData` function is called with the response as its parameter. This function extracts data about the first actor in the response and then writes it to a file using the `appendDataToFile` function. The data includes the actor's name, birthday, gender, country, and URL.

The `findShow` method takes a `show` parameter, which is used to search for TV shows using the TVMaze API. The method constructs a URL using the `show` parameter and then makes an HTTP GET request to the URL using `axios`. When the response is received, the `processTvShowData` function is called with the response as its parameter. This function extracts data about the TV show from the response and then writes it to a file using the `appendDataToFile` function. The data includes the show's name, genres, rating, network, and summary.
***
This code exports a constructor function `TV` and two methods, `findActor` and `findShow`, to search for TV shows and actors using the tvmaze API.

`findActor` takes an actor name as a parameter and searches for the first matching actor using the tvmaze API. If found, it extracts relevant data such as name, birthday, gender, country, and URL, formats it as a string, and appends it to a file using the `appendDataToFile` function.

`findShow` takes a TV show name as a parameter and searches for the show using the tvmaze API. If found, it extracts relevant data such as name, genres, rating, network, and summary, formats it as a string, and appends it to a file using the `appendDataToFile` function.

The `axios` library is used to make HTTP requests to the tvmaze API and retrieve data. The `appendDataToFile` function is used to append data to a file.

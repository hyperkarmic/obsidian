The `character.js` file defines a `Character` class that represents a game character and provides methods to interact with it.

The `printStats()` method prints the stats of the character, including their name, strength, and hit points. The `isAlive()` method checks if the character's hit points are less than zero and returns a boolean value indicating whether the character is alive or dead. The `attack(opponent)` method takes in another character object, prints an attack message, and reduces the opponent's hit points by the attacking character's strength.

To use the `Character` class, we can create two unique characters using the constructor and then set up an interval that alternates their attacks every 2000 milliseconds.

Here is an example code snippet demonstrating the usage of the `Character` class:

```javascript
// Import the Character class
const Character = require('./character');

// Create two unique characters
const player1 = new Character('Player 1', 10, 100);
const player2 = new Character('Player 2', 8, 120);

// Set up an interval that alternates attacks every 2000 milliseconds
setInterval(() => {
  player1.attack(player2);
  player2.attack(player1);
}, 2000);

```

In this example, we first import the `Character` class from the `character.js` file. Then we create two unique characters, `player1` and `player2`, with different strength and hit point values. Finally, we set up an interval that alternates the characters' attacks every 2000 milliseconds using the `attack()` method.

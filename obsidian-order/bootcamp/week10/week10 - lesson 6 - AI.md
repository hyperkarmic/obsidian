This code implements a Character constructor function that creates objects representing RPG characters with properties such as name, profession, age, strength, and hitPoints. It also defines some prototype methods that allow for checking if a character is alive or not, attacking another character, and leveling up a character by increasing their age, strength, and hitPoints. Finally, it creates two character objects, Bob and Alice, and prints their stats, and demonstrates the use of some of the prototype methods by having Alice attack Bob, check if Bob is alive, and level up Alice.

Learning Outcomes:

-   Understanding the use of constructor functions and object properties in JavaScript.
-   Understanding how to define and use prototype methods in JavaScript.
-   Understanding how to create and work with objects in JavaScript.

Code Explanation:

-   The constructor function `Character` takes an object `character` and assigns its properties to the newly created object using `this`.
-   The prototype method `printStats` creates a string that displays all of the character's properties and logs it to the console.
-   The prototype method `isAlive` checks if the character's hitPoints are above zero, and logs whether the character is alive or dead.
-   The prototype method `attack` takes another character object as a parameter and subtracts the attacking character's strength from the opponent's hitPoints.
-   The prototype method `levelUp` increases the character's age by 1, strength by 5, and hitPoints by 25.
-   Two character objects, Bob and Alice, are created using the `Character` constructor and their properties are defined.
-   Bob and Alice's stats are printed to the console using the `printStats` prototype method.
-   Alice attacks Bob using the `attack` prototype method and Bob's stats are printed again.
-   Bob's status is checked using the `isAlive` prototype method.
-   Alice is leveled up using the `levelUp` prototype method and her stats are printed to the console.

Key Code Snippets:

-   Creating a new character using the `Character` constructor:

```javascript
const bob = new Character({
  name: "Bob",
  profession: "Lawyer",
  age: 28,
  strength: 7,
  hitPoints: 50,
});

```

Defining a prototype method to check if a character is alive:

```javascript
Character.prototype.isAlive = function () {
  if (this.hitPoints > 0) {
    console.log(`${this.name} is alive`);
    return true;
  } else {
    console.log(`${this.name} is dead`);
    return false;
  }
};

```

Defining a prototype method to level up a character:

```javascript
Character.prototype.levelUp = function () {
  this.age += 1;
  this.strength += 5;
  this.hitPoints += 25;

  console.log('Level up complete!!');
};

```

Creating a new character object and calling its `printStats` method:

```javascript
const alice = new Character({
  name: "Alice",
  profession: "Florist",
  age: 24,
  strength: 9,
  hitPoints: 40,
});

alice.printStats();

```

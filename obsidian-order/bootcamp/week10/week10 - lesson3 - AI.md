The `minibank.js` file contains a constructor function `MiniBank` that creates an object representing a bank account. The `MiniBank` object has several methods that allow the user to deposit, withdraw, and check their balance and transaction history.

The `MiniBank` constructor takes a `balance` parameter which represents the initial balance of the bank account. It also initializes an array `statement` with `balance` as the first element.

The methods of the `MiniBank` object include:

-   `setBalance`: a setter function that sets the `balance` property to a specified value.
-   `updateStatement`: a function that takes in a number and pushes it to the `statement` array to record a transaction.
-   `getStatement`: a function that returns a copy of the `statement` array.
-   `printStatement`: a function that prints each element in the `statement` array on its own line.
-   `deposit`: a function that takes a value and performs a deposit transaction. It calls `updateStatement` to record the deposit transaction, then calls `setBalance` to update the `balance` property.
-   `withdraw`: a function that takes a value and performs a withdrawal transaction. It calls `updateStatement` to record the withdrawal transaction (using a negative number), then calls `setBalance` to update the `balance` property.
-   `getBalance`: a getter function that returns the current balance of the account.
-   `printBalance`: a function that prints the current balance of the account.

The code also creates an instance of `MiniBank` called `bank`, and performs some basic operations such as depositing and withdrawing money from the account, checking the balance, and printing the transaction history.

Some bonus features mentioned in the `readme.md` file include throwing errors if the user tries to withdraw more money than they have, or tries to deposit or withdraw non-positive numbers. Additionally, the `getStatement` function could be updated to return a copy of the `statement` array instead of the original array.

Overview:

The MiniBank exercise involves creating a mini banking application using objects in JavaScript. The program is made up of two parts, where the first part involves adding methods and properties to the MiniBank constructor function. The second part requires creating and using a MiniBank instance.

Part 1:

1.  A property named `statement` is defined and assigned an initial value of an array containing the `balance` parameter passed to the constructor.
2.  A function named `setBalance` is added that receives a `value` parameter and assigns it to the `balance` property of `MiniBank`.
3.  A function named `updateStatement` is added that takes in a number and pushes it to the `statement` array.
4.  A function named `getStatement` is added that returns the `statement` property.
5.  A function named `printStatement` is added that prints each element in the `statement` array on its own line.
6.  A function named `deposit` is added that takes a value and performs the following:
    -   Calls `updateStatement` to record the deposit transaction.
    -   Calls `setBalance` to update the `balance` property.
7.  A function named `withdraw` is added that takes a value and performs the following:
    -   Calls `updateStatement` to record the withdrawal transaction.
    -   Calls `setBalance` to update the `balance` property.

Part 2:

1.  A new `bank` object is created using the `MiniBank` constructor function.
2.  The `bank` balance is printed.
3.  Some money is deposited into the `bank` object.
4.  The `bank` balance is printed.
5.  Some money is withdrawn from the `bank` object.
6.  The `bank` balance is printed.

Bonus:

-   Code is added to throw an error if the user tries to withdraw more money than they have, or try to deposit or withdraw values that aren't positive numbers.
-   Code is added to return a copy of the `statement` array when `getStatement` is called, rather than returning the original array.

Learning Outcomes:

This exercise provides the opportunity to learn and understand the use of objects, properties, and methods in JavaScript. It also demonstrates the concept of constructors, which can be used to create multiple instances of an object. In addition, the exercise highlights the importance of error handling in programming and shows how to throw and handle errors in JavaScript.

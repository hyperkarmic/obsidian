# Closures - definitions
### Closures are commonly used in JavaScript for things like creating functions that need to remember information about the environment they were created in. For example, when you create an event listener, the function that is called when the event occurs needs to remember what element it was attached to. This can be done using a closure:

### Closure: a function that closes over local variables. A function within another function. The inner function remembers the environment in which it was created and has access to the outer function's variables and parameters. The function 'freezes' the code in its body and wraps it into a package

# 12 Agile Principles
The [12 principles of agile software development](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) as outlined in the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) are as follows:

1.  _Our highest priority is to [satisfy the customer](https://blog.logrocket.com/product-management/12-agile-manifesto-principles-how-to-adopt-them/#1-satisfy-the-customer) through early and continuous delivery of valuable software._
2.  _[Welcome changing requirements](https://blog.logrocket.com/product-management/12-agile-manifesto-principles-how-to-adopt-them/#2-welcome-changing-requirements), even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage._
3.  _[Deliver working software frequently](https://blog.logrocket.com/product-management/12-agile-manifesto-principles-how-to-adopt-them/#3-deliver-working-software-frequently), from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale._
4.  _Business people and developers must [work together daily](https://blog.logrocket.com/product-management/12-agile-manifesto-principles-how-to-adopt-them/#work-together-daily) throughout the project._
5.  _[Build projects around motivated individuals](https://blog.logrocket.com/product-management/12-agile-manifesto-principles-how-to-adopt-them/#5-build-projects-around-motivated-individuals). Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done._
6.  _The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is [face-to-face conversation](https://blog.logrocket.com/product-management/12-agile-manifesto-principles-how-to-adopt-them/#6-engage-in-face-to-face-communication)._
7.  _Working software is the [primary measure of progress](https://blog.logrocket.com/product-management/12-agile-manifesto-principles-how-to-adopt-them/#7-measure-progress-by-working-products)._
8.  _Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to [maintain a constant pace indefinitely](https://blog.logrocket.com/product-management/12-agile-manifesto-principles-how-to-adopt-them/#8-maintain-a-constant-pace-indefinitely)._
9.  _[Continuous attention to technical excellence](https://blog.logrocket.com/product-management/12-agile-manifesto-principles-how-to-adopt-them/#9-pay-continuous-attention-to-technical-excellence) and good design enhances agility._
10.  _[Simplicity](https://blog.logrocket.com/product-management/12-agile-manifesto-principles-how-to-adopt-them/#10-keep-it-simple) — the art of maximizing the amount of work not done — is essential._
11.  _The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from [self-organizing teams](https://blog.logrocket.com/product-management/12-agile-manifesto-principles-how-to-adopt-them/#trust-your-team)._
12.  _At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then [tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly](https://blog.logrocket.com/product-management/12-agile-manifesto-principles-how-to-adopt-them/#reflect-and-adapt)._

#  Waterfall
Waterfall was invented by manufacturing companies as a sequential step-by-step process of software development, similar to the hardware-production model. Each change would be separately estimated, and therefore the budgets would dramatically increase.




## steps 
-   Requirements definition
-   Design
-   Development
-   Quality assurance
-   Maintenance

######  The black hat makes us consider the reasons why something may not work, why it may be illegal, why it may go wrong, or why it’s not worth doing but the reason must be logical

The problem with waterfall is that each phase must be completed fully before progressing to the next phase. However, the design and development process is not sequential.

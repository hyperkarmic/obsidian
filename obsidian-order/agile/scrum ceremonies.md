# Scrum ceremonies
Let’s have a look at each of the four agile ceremonies in Scrum:

# 1. Stand up (or daily Scrum)

**Goal of the stand up:** a brief check-in where the team can raise issues or communicate with the whole team face to face.

**Who joins the daily stand up:** Developers, Scrum Master, Product Owner

**Outcome of daily stand up:** the team raises any blockers, but doesn’t have to solve them. Ensure each team member is clear about what they are working on. Each team member should be able to answer these three questions:

>What did I complete yesterday?

>What will I work on today?

>Am I blocked by anything?

**When to hold a stand up:** daily

# 2. Sprint Planning

**Goal of sprint planning:** sprint planning helps the team prepare for what work is coming up next. The team discusses each item of work which has been prioritised by the Product Owner.

**Who does sprint planning:** Developers, Product Owner, Scrum Master

**Outcome of sprint planning:** that everyone knows what the sprint goal is and how they are going to achieve it. Make sure everyone understands what’s the overall vision or objective of the work.

The team will be comfortable with what work is available to be picked up in the next sprint. The team will discuss any impediments or opportunities and how they can optimise the way the work will be completed.

The team will also estimate the work and draw a line when it is estimated that the effort to complete the work exceeds the team’s capacity or historical velocity.

**When to hold sprint planning:** at the end of a sprint or very beginning of a new sprint.

# 3. Sprint review

**Goal of the sprint review:** showcase the work completed and receive feedback from the Product Owner and relevant stakeholders.

**Who joins the sprint review:** Executive Sponsors, Developers, Scrum Master, Product Owner

**Outcome of the sprint review:** each team member feels empowered by showcasing their work to the team. The team can celebrate their achievements. Executive team can ask questions. Product owner can provide feedback and check the work is of high quality and satisfies the [user story](https://blog.easyagile.com/how-to-write-good-user-stories-in-agile-software-development-d4b25356b604). Works best with drinks and cake.

**When to hold a sprint review:** at the end of each sprint.
***
# 4. Retrospective

**Goal of the retrospective:** honest discussion about what worked well and didn’t work well. Encourage self-improvement and transparency.

**Who joins the retrospective:** Developers, Scrum Master, Product Owner

**Outcome of a retrospective:** receive feedback from the team and seek to improve in the following sprint. The beauty of agile and Scrum is the fast feedback loop.

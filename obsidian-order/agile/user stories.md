## user stories
In consultation with the customer or [product owner](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/product-owner/), the team divides up the work to be done into functional increments called “user stories.”

Each user story is expected to yield, once implemented, a contribution to the value of the overall product, irrespective of the order of implementation; these and other assumptions as to the nature of user stories are captured by the [INVEST](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/invest/) formula.

To make these assumptions tangible, user stories are reified into a physical form: an index card or sticky note, on which a brief descriptive sentence is written to serve as a reminder of its value. This emphasizes the “atomic” nature of user stories and encourages [direct physical manipulation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_manipulation_interface): for instance, decisions about scheduling are made by physically moving around these “story cards.”

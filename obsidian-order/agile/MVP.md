# MVP

MVP:MVP should be solving the most important use-cases and solve them well.

Most of the major problems (~80%) should be addressed in MVP (~20%).

As the Pareto principle says the majority of results come from the minority of causes, MVP is the cause that covers 80% of the use-cases.
***
The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is typically the minimal functionality required to meet the root needs of the user. Many times this sacrifices the non-essential but desired features. While the name infers being stripped down to the bare essentials, it includes much more than the previous phases. The development team should not make the decisions of the included functions and features in isolation. Stakeholders were important before but are invaluable in this phase. Much more planning is required developing the MVP.

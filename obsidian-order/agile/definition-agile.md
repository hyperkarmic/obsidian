Agile:Agile is a mindset and philosophy around building products that espouses collaboration, customer-centricity, and expecting and responding to change.
***
Based on the [Agile Development Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) created in 2001, agile adheres to the following principles:

-   Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
-   Working software over comprehensive documentation.
-   Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
-   Responding to change over following a plan.
***
Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a “big bang” launch, an agile team delivers work in small, but consumable, increments. Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly.

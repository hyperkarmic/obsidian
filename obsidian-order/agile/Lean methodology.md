What is the lean methodology?
The lean startup concept was first coined by Eric Ries, an American entrepreneur and author, in his book The Lean Startup. In the words of Ries:

“The Lean Startup method teaches you how to drive a startup-how to steer, when to turn, and when to persevere-and grow a business with maximum acceleration.”

Lean refers to delivering value to the customer by eliminating waste. Lean product management means applying lean startup principles to the product development lifecycle.

## Preamble: Continuous learning is critical

Â Issued in 2001 by 17 seasoned software engineers,

The Agile Manifesto (68 words) specifies four values that guide its principles for efficient software product development. The four values of the Agile Manifesto are:

{{_We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:_}}

1.  Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2.  Working software over comprehensive documentation
3.  Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4.  Responding to change over following a plan


{{_That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more._}}

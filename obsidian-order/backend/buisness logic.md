Buisness Logic: Business logic is the custom rules or algorithms that handle the exchange of information between a database and user interface. Business logic is essentially the part of a computer program that contains the information (in the form of business rules) that defines or constrains how a business operates.

###### Buisness Logic: Business logic is the custom rules or [algorithms](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/algorithm.asp) that handle the exchange of information between a database and user interface. Business logic is essentially the part of a computer program that contains the information (in the form of business rules) that defines or constrains how a business operates. Such business rules are operational policies that are usually expressed in true or false binaries. Business logic can be seen in the workflows that they support, such as in sequences or steps that specify in detail the proper flow of information or data, and therefore decision-making. Business logic is also known as "domain logic."

Business logic layer. This layer contains a set of components that are responsible for processing the data received from the UI layer. It implements all the necessary application logic, all the calculations. It interacts with the database and passes the result of processing to the UI layer.

Business logic is the programming that manages communication between an end user interface and a database. The main components of business logic are [business rules](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/business-rule) and [workflows](https://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/workflow). A business rule describes a specific procedure; a workflow consists of the tasks, procedural steps, required input and output information, and tools needed for each step of that procedure. Business logic describes the sequence of operations associated with data in a database to carry out the business rule.

# environment variable
Environment Variable: An environment variable is a variable whose value is set outside a program, typically through the operating system. Environment variables eliminate the need to define and redefine variables through programs.

**A QUICK RECAP**

-   environment variables are normal variables except they exist and used by our system
-   we can create our own environment variables in our programs to avoid hardcoding sensitive information and compromising our apps
-   `.env` files are used to store those variables and they should be written in all uppercase separated with underscores for naming convention
-   we access those variables through `process.env` after installing `dotnev` npm package
-   we use `.gitignore` file to avoid having our `.env` files pushed to our repo when we use version control to share on Github

**Controller:** The controller acts as an intermediary between the view and the model, enabling the interconnection between those two components. It is also known as the brain of the app. The controller’s task is to determine which model to call and then open the appropriate function within that model.

It doesn’t define the data logically, it gives the command to the model to do it. It receives the data, sends it to the view, and explains how to represent it to the user. The controller also handles and responds to user input and interaction. For example, the controller handles query-string values and passes these values to the model, which in turn might use these values to query the database.

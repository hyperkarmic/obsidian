# Design Patterns
#### A software design pattern is an optimised, repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software engineering. It is a template for solving a problem that can be used in many different situations.

There are three types of design pattern

-   **Creational**: They provide object instantiation mechanisms.
-   **Structural**: They focus on object composition into bigger structures.
-   **Behavioural**: They take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities across objects.

Design Pattern:A Design Pattern is a simple, scalable, highly reusable solution to a recurring software architecture problem. Twenty-three of those patterns were compiled in a best seller book by the Gang of Four in the early 90s, which very quickly gained widespread adoption and became a cornerstone of the software development field.

Design Pattern:Design Patterns aren't about classes, objects, or even composition vs inheritance. They are a compendium of complex problems and their simple, scalable, highly reusable solutions — and that's where our focus should be.

In Software Engineering, Design patterns are templates to solve common problems. However, they are generalized solutions; hence you cannot directly apply them to any specific use case.

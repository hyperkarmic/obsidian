# Design Patterns
#### A software design pattern is an optimised, repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software engineering. It is a template for solving a problem that can be used in many different situations.

There are three types of design pattern

-   **Creational**: They provide object instantiation mechanisms.
-   **Structural**: They focus on object composition into bigger structures.
-   **Behavioural**: They take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities across objects.

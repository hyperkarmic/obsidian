A decorator is a way to dynamically add functionality while code is running, and it can be used to modify the behavior of a class or function, typically for:

1.  Extend existing class or function functionality;
2.  Modify the properties of a class or function;
3.  Convert a class or function to a different form, for example, to a singleton pattern.

In JavaScript, there are many ways to implement decorators, the most common of which are to use decorator functions and class decorators.

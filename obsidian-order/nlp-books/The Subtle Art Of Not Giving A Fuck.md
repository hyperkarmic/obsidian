# The subtle art of not giving a fuck - Mark Manson

### Parker Klein Notes
-   Be completely honest with yourself.
    
-   A rich person doesn't need to keep reminding themselves that they are rich.
    
-   Giving too many f*cks is bad for your mental health.
    
-   Be comfortable being different.
    
-   The avoidance of struggle is to struggle.
    
-   You are going to die soon.
    
-   Pick what matters to you based upon personal values. Say f*ck it to everything that doesn't matter to you in life.
    
-   If you reserve your f*cks for only the things that matter, you'll perform better on what's important.
    
-   Have meaningful things to give your f*cks about.
    
-   Maturity is learning to only give a f*ck about what is f*ckworthy.
    
-   Don't try.
    
-   You get to choose what to give a f*ck about.
    
-   There is no value in suffering when it is done without purpose.
    
-   Happiness occurs when solving problems you enjoy having.
    
-   Solve problems. Be happy.
    
-   What pain do you want in your life?
    
-   Who you are is defined by what you are willing to struggle for.
    
-   Our struggles determine our success.
    
-   People that become great at something become great because they understand they are not already great.
    
-   The vast majority of your life will be average and not noteworthy and that is okay. The pressure to be the next big thing will be lifted off your back.
    
-   You will have a growing appreciation for life's basic experiences. Basic friendship, creating something, helping a person in need, reading a good book, laughing with someone you care about.
    
-   It's the ordinary things that actually matter.
    
-   For what higher purpose are you suffering.
    
-   Self-awareness is an onion. There are multiple layers and the more you pull back, you will start crying.
    
-   This is why self-awareness questions are important because they illuminate what we consider success or failure.
    
-   Honest self-questioning is difficult and requires asking questions that are difficult to answer. The more uncomfortable the answer the more true it is.
    
-   One day, the years of struggle will strike you as the most precious.
    
-   Good values are reality based, socially constructive, immediate, and controllable.
    
-   Bad values are superstitious, socially destructive, not immediate, or controllable.
    
-   Honesty is a good value, popularity is a bad value.
    
-   Prioritize better values and things to give a f*ck about.
    
-   You are 100% responsible for everything in life.
    
-   We don't always control what happens but we control how we interpret what happens.
    
-   Chip away at what you are doing wrong today so you can do a little less wrong tomorrow.
    
-   Happiness comes from caring about something bigger than yourself.
    
-   Everyone is great already, whether we realize it or not.
    
-   We are great because we continue to choose what to give a f*ck about.

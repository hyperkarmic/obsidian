# Ray Dallo - Principles
### Parker Klein Notes:
-   If we classify situations we need to respond to into types and have good principles for dealin with them, we will make better decisions more quickly and have better lives as a result
    
-   If you can think for yourself while being open minded in a clearheaded way to find out what is best for you to do, and if you can summon up the courage to do it, you will make the most of your life
    
-   Think for yourself to decide 1) what you want 2) what is true and 3) what you should do to achieve #1 in light of #2 and do that with humility and open mindedness so that you consider the best thinking available to you
    
-   People who have shared values and principles get along
    
-   The key to success lies in knowing how to Birch Drive for a lot and feel well
    
-   Feeling well means being able to experience pain for failures that provide big lanes without feeling badly enough to get knocked out of the game
    
-   Strive for a lot and fail well
    
-   Failing well
    
-   Audacious goals -> failure -> learning principles -> improving -> more audacious goals
    
-   To be a successful entrepreneur one has to be an independent thinker who correctly bets against the consensus which means being painfully wrong a fair amount
    
-   Reflect on and write down my decision making criteria whenever I make a decision
    
-   Time is like a river that carries us forward into encounters with reality that require us to make decisions we can’t stop our movement down this river and we can’t avoid those encounters. We can only approach b them in the best way possible
    
-   Fear boredom and mediocrity much more than failure. Great is better than terrible, and terrible is better than mediocre, because terrible at least gives life flavor
    
-   "If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away."
    
-   Prices reflect people's expectations, so they go up when actual results are better than expected and they go down when they are worse than expected. And most people tend to be biased by their recent experiences
    
-   'You better make sense of what happened to other people in other times and other places because if you don't you won't know if these things can happen to you and, if they do, you won't know how to deal with them.'
    
-   When everyone thinks the same thing - such as what a sure bet the Nifty 50 is - it is almost certainly reflected in the price, and betting on it is probably going to be a mistake
    
-   For every action there is a consequence roughly proportionate to that action, which causes an approximately equal and opposite reaction and market reversals
    
-   When people are very pessimistic, they sell out, prices typically get very cheap, and action to improve conditions has to be taken
    
-   Use business to get into exotic places and meet interesting people. If you can also make money on those trips, that's just icing on the cake
    
-   Visualize complex systems as machines, figure out the cause-effect relationships within them, write down the principles for dealing with them, and feed them into a computer so the computer can make decisions for me
    
-   You can never be sure of anything: There are always risks out there that can hurt you badly, even in the most seemingly safest bets, so it's always best to assume you're missing something
    
-   Meaningful work and meaningful relationships are far better than making money
    
-   Monies value comes from what it can buy, and it can't buy everything. It's smarter to start with what you really want, which are your real goals, and then work back to what you need to attain them
    
-   Timing is everything
    
-   Ask “how do I know I’m right?”
    
-   Just be right, don’t care if the right answer comes from you
    
-   Find other independent thinkers who are on the same mission as you and who see things different than you
    
-   1. Seek out the smartest people who disagreed with me so I could try to understand their reasoning. 2. Know when not to have an opinion 3. Develop, test, and systemize timeless and universal principles. 4. Balance risks in ways that keep the big upside while reducing the downside
    
-   Build an idea meritocracy, not an autocracy in which I lead and others follow, and not a democracy in which everyone’s vote is equal, but a meritocracy that encourages thoughtful disagreements and explores and weights peoples opinions in proportion to their merits
    
-   By doing what comes naturally to us we fail to account for our weaknesses which leads to a crash
    
-   What happens after we crash is most important
    
-   Successful people change in ways that allow them to continue to take advantage of their strengths while compensating for their weaknesses
    
-   Beneficial change begins when you can acknowledge and even embrace your weaknesses

-   Wise people stick with sound fundamentals through the ups and downs
    
-   Bad times coupled with good reflections provide some of the best lessons
    
-   Having an ability to figure things out is more important than having specific knowledge of how to do something
    
-   If you punish errors, people will hide them which will lead to even bigger and more costly errors
    
-   Create an error log to help reinforce desired behaviors
    
-   When faced with the choice between two things you need that are seemingly at odds go slowly to figure out how you can have as much of both as possible
    
-   There is almost always a good path that you just haven’t figured out yet so look for it until you find it rather than settle for the choice that is then apparent to you
    
-   To have a real idea meritocracy, there must be transparency so that people can see things for themselves
    
-   The greatest success you can have as the person in charge is to orchestrate others to do things well without you

-   They start out leading ordinary lives in an ordinary world and are drawn by a call to adventure. This leads them down a road of trials filled with battles temptations successes and failures
    
-   They overcome their fear of fighting because of their great determination to achieve what they want and they gain their special powers from both battles that test and teach them and from gifts that they receive from others
    
-   Heros inevitably experience at least one very big failure that tests whether they have the resilience to come back and fight smarter and with more determination. If they do, they undergone a change in which they experience the fear that protects them without losing the aggressiveness that propels them forward

-   Each if us need to decide what we value most and choose the path we take to achieve it
    
-   None of us is born knowing what is true. We either have to discover what’s true for ourselves or believe and follow others

-   Most everything that at first seems 'bad,' when put in the context of the fact that reality is built to optimize for the whole rather than me, really isn't that bad and is just nature

# One Minute Manger - Kenneth Blanchard And Spencer Johnson
## Parker Klein Notes
-   Take a minute out of our day to look into the faces of the people we manage and to realize that they are our most important resources
    
-   The essence of knowledge is, having it, to use it - Confucious
    
-   Tough manager's organizations win while their people lose
    
-   "Nice" managers people win while their organization loses
    
-   Effective managers manage themselves and the people they work with so that both the organization and the people profit from their presence
    
-   In meetings, listen while your people review and analyze what they accomplished last week, the problems they had, and what still needs to be accomplished. Then help to develop plans and strategies for the next week
    
-   Don't participate in any of your people's decision-making
    
-   We're here to get results. The purpose of the organization is efficiency. By being organized we are a great deal more productive
    
-   People and results go hand in hand
    
-   People who feel good about themselves produce good results
    
-   You get more done when you feel good about yourself
    
-   Helping people feel good about themselves is a key to getting more done
    
-   Productivity is quantity and quality of the work
    
-   Quality is simply giving the people the product or service they really want and need
    
-   A One Minute Manager — someone who gets good results without taking much time
    
-   I don't make decisions for other people
    
-   The One Minute Manager always makes it clear what our responsibilities are and what we are being held accountable for
    
-   Once he tells you what needs to be done or they have agreed on what needs to be done, then each goal is recorded on no more than a single page. It should take no more than 250 words. You can read it within a minute. Both parties get a copy
    
-   80% of your really important results will come from 20% of your goals
    
-   One Minute Goal Setting — no surprises, everyone knows what is expected from the beginning. Performance standards are clear
    
-   People are hired to solve problems
    
-   One of your goals for the future is to identify and solve your own problems. Put it in behavioral terms or terms that are observable and measurable
    
-   If you can't say what you'd like to be happening, you don't have a problem yet. You're just complaining. A problem only exists if there is a difference between what is actually happening and what you desire to be happening
    
-   You only have a good solution if you do it and what you want to happen happens
    
-   Show them how to solve their own problems on their own in the future by asking them questions that they can ask themselves. If you do A, will what you want to happen actually happen?
    
-   You're good
    
-   One Minute Goal Setting
    
-   Agree on your goals
    
-   See what good behavior looks like
    
-   Write out each of your goals on a single sheet of paper using less than 250 words
    
-   Read and re-read each goal, which requires only a minute or so each time you do it
    
-   Take a minute every once in a while out of your day to look at your performance
    
-   See whether or not your behavior matches your goal
    
-   Jot things down to remember them
    
-   Let them know when they are doing well and when they are doing poorly
    
-   Help people reach their full potential. Catch them doing something right
    
-   Put your hand on their shoulder and let them know you really care about them and want them to prosper
    
-   The more consistently successful your people are, the higher you rise in the organization
    
-   Look them in the eye and tell them precisely what they did right. Share how good you feel about what they did
    
-   One Minute Praising
    
-   Tell people up front that you are going to let them know how they are doing
    
-   Praise people immediately
    
-   Tell people what they did right—be specific
    
-   Tell people how good you feel about what they did right, and how it helps the organization and the other people who work there
    
-   Stop for a moment of silence to let them "feel" how good you feel
    
-   Encourage them to do more of the same
    
-   Shake hands or touch people in a way that makes it clear that you support their success in the organization
    
-   If you don't blow your own horn, someone else will use it as a spittoon
    
-   Be able to laugh at yourself when you make a mistake
    
-   The One Minute Reprimand
    
-   Tell people beforehand that you are going to let them know how they are doing and in no uncertain terms
    
-   Reprimand people immediately
    
-   Tell people what they did wrong—be specific
    
-   Tell people how you feel about what they did wrong—and in no uncertain terms
    
-   Stop for a few seconds of uncomfortable silence to let them feel how you feel
    
-   Shake hands, or touch them in a way that lets them know you are honestly on their side
    
-   Remind them how much you value them
    
-   Reaffirm that you think well of them but not of their performance in this situation
    
-   Realize that when the preimand is over, it's over
    
-   The best minute I spend is the one I invest in people
    
-   Feedback is the breakfast of champions
    
-   Never clutter your mind with information you can find somewhere else
    
-   Everyone is a potential winner. Some people are disguised as losers, don't let their appearances fool you
    
-   Take a minute: look at your goals, look at your performance, see if your behavior matches your goals
    
-   People are aware, they think for themselves, and they certainly don't want to be manipulated by another person
    
-   We seek what feels good to us and we avoid what feels bad to us
    
-   The most important thing in training somebody to become a winner is to catch them doing something right—in the beginning approximately right and gradually moving them towards the desired behavior
    
-   Good performers catch themselves doing things right and are able to be self-reinforcing
    
-   You're always trying to create situations in the beginning where you can give a One Minute Praising
    
-   Unless discipline occurs as close to the misbehavior as possible, it tends not to be as helpful in influencing future behavior
    
-   When the manager deals with one behavior at a time, it seems more fair and clear
    
-   Never attack a person's worth or value as a person. Reprimand the behavior only. Eliminate the behavior and keep the person
    
-   Before giving a reprimand you have to see the behavior yourself—you can't depend on what someone else saw. You never give a reprimand based on 'hearsay.'
    
-   We are not just our behavior. We are the person managing our behavior
    
-   You are managing people, not just their recent behavior
    
-   Touch is a very powerful message. People have strong feelings about being touched, and that needs to be respected. Touch is very honest. People know immediately when you touch them whether you care about them, or whether you are just trying to find a new way to manipulate them
    
-   When you touch, don't take. Touch the people you manage only when you are giving them something—reassurance, support, encouragement, whatever
    
-   Be very tough on poor performance. Never tough on the person
    
-   Goals begin behaviors. Consequences maintain behaviors
    
-   Nobody ever really works for anybody else
    
-   Ask brief, important questions. Speak simple truth. Laugh. Work. Enjoy
    
-   Share it with others

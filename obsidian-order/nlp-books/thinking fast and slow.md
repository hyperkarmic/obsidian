# Daniel Kahnman - Thinking Fast and Slow
-   Questioning what we believe and want is difficult. We can benefit from the informed opinions of others.
    
-   Systematic errors are known biases, and they recur predictably in particular circumstances
    
-   Having seen themselves fail, they became more likely to question the dogmatic assumption, prevalent at the time, that the human mind is rational and logical
    
-   Luck plays a large role in every story of success
    
-   Judgment heuristics 'are quite useful, but sometimes lead to severe and systematic errors.'
    
-   Expert intuition strikes us as magical, but it is not
    
-   'The situation has provided a cue; this cue has given the expert access to information stored in memory, and the information provides the answer. Intuition is nothing more and nothing less than recognition.'
    
-   The affect heuristic, where judgments and decisions are guided directly by feelings of liking and disliking, with little deliberation or reasoning
    
-   Intuitive heuristics: when faced with a difficult question, we often answer an easier one instead, usually without noticing the substitution
    
-   The spontaneous search for ann intuitive solution sometimes fails. We often find ourselves switching to a slower, more deliberate and effortful form of thing.
    
-   Fast thinking includes both variants of intuitive thought—the expert and the heuristic
    
-   I describe mental life by the metaphor of two agents, called System 1 and System 2, which respectively produce fast and slow thinking
    
-   Features of intuitive and deliberate thought as if they were traits and dispositions of two characters in your mind
    
-   The intuitive System 1 is more influential than your experience tells you, and it is the secret author of many of the choices and judgments you make
    
-   Associative memory, the core of System 1, continually constructs a coherent interpretation of what is going on in our world at any instant
    
-   A puzzling limitation of our mind: our excessive confidence inn what we believe we know, and our apparent inability to acknowledge the full extend of our ignorance and the uncertainty of the world we live in. We are prone to overestimate how much we understand about the world and to underestimate the role of chance in events.
    
-   Overconfidence is fed by the illusory certainty of hindsight
    
-   Two selves, the experiencing self and the remembering self, do not have the same interests
    
-   System 1 operated automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control
    
-   System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. The operations of System 2 are often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration
    
-   We identify with System 2, the conscious, reasoning self that has beliefs, makes choices, and decides what to think about and what to do
    
-   System 1 is the hero. Effortlessly originating impressions and feelings that we the main sources of the explicit beliefs and deliberate choices of System 2
    
-   Only the slower System 2 can construct thoughts in an orderly series of steps
    
-   System 2 takes over, overruling the freewheeling impulses and associations of System 1
    
-   The capabilities of System 1 include innate skills that we share with other animals. We are born prepared to perceive the world around us, recognize objects, orient attention, avoid losses
    
-   Mental activities become fast and automatic through prolonged practice
    
-   The knowledge is stored in memory and accessed without intention and without effor
    
-   Attention can be moved away from an unwanted focus primarily by focusing intently on another target
    
-   You must pay attention, and you will perform less well, or not at all, if you are not ready or if your attention is directed inappropriately
    
-   Intense focusing on a task can make people effectively blind, even to stimuli that normally attract attention
    
-   We can be blind to the obvious, and we are also blind to our blindness
    
-   System 1 and 2 are both active whenever we are awake. System 1 runs automatically and System 2 is normally in a comfortable low-effort mode. System 1 continuously generates suggestions for System 2: impressions, intuitions, and feelings. If endorsed by System 2, impressions and intuitions turn into beliefs, and impulses turn into volunntary actions
    
-   When System 2 runs into difficulty, it calls on System 2 to support more detailed and specific processing that may solve the problem of the moment
    
-   Most of what you (your System 2) think and do originates in your System 1, but System 2 takes over when things get difficult, and it normally has the last word
    
-   The division of labor between System 1 and System 2 is highly efficient: it minimizes effort and optimizes performance
    
-   System 1 cannot be turned off
    
-   Conflict between an automatic reaction and an intention to control it is common in our lives
    
-   System 2 is in charge of self-control
    
-   System 1 operates automatically and cannot be turned off at will, errors of intuitive thought are often difficult to prevent. Biases cannot always be avoided, because System 2 may have no clue to the error. Even when cues to likely errors are available, errors can be prevented only by the enhanced monitoring and effortful activity of System 2. Continuous vigilance is not necessarily good, and it is certainly impractical. Constantly questioning our own thinking would be impossibly tedious, and System 2 is much too slow and inefficient to serve as a substitute for System 1 in making routine decisions. Learn to recognize situations in which mistakes are likely and try harder to avoid significant mistakes when the stakes are high.
    
-   It is easier to recognize other people's mistakes than our own
    
-   Anything that occupies your working memory reduces your ability to think
    
-   System 2's operations are effortful, and one of its main characteristics is laziness, a reluctance to invest more effort than is strictly necessary. As a consequence, the thoughts and actions that System 2 believes it has chosen are often guided by the figure at the center of the story, System 1
    
-   The pupil of the eye as a window to the soul
    
-   When engaged in a mental sprint, may become effectively blind
    
-   The pupils offer an index of the current rate at which mental energy is used
    
-   System 2 protects the most important activity, so it receives the attention it needs; 'spare capacity' is allocated second by second to other tasks
    
-   Orienting and responding quickly to the gravest threats or most promising opportunities improved the chance of survival, and this capability is certainly not restricted to humans
    
-   System 1 takes over in emergencies and assigns total priority to self-protective actions
    
-   As you become skilled in a task, its demand for energy diminishes
    
-   Highly intelligent individuals need less effort to solve the same problem, as indicated by both pupil size and brain activity
    
-   If there are several ways of achieving the same goal, people will eventually gravitate to the least demanding course of action
    
-   Effort is a cost, and the acquisition of skill is driven by the balance of benefits and costs. Laziness is built deep into our nature
    
-   System 2 is the only one that can follow rules, compare objects on several attributes and make deliberate choices between options
    
-   System 1 detects simple relations and excels at integrating information about one thing, but it does not deal with multiple distinct topics at once, nor is it adept at using purely statistical information
    
-   Prefrontal area of the brain involved in operations that we associate with intelligence
    
-   Switching from one task to another is effortful, especially under time pressure
    
-   We normally avoid mental overload by dividing our tasks into multiple easy steps, committing intermediate results to long-term memory or to paper rather than to an easily overloaded working memory
    
-   Self-control and deliberate thought apparently draw on the same limited budget of effort
    
-   Even in the absence of time pressure, maintaining a coherent train of thought requires discipline
    
-   In a state of flow. maintaining focused attention on these absorbing activities requires no exertion of self-control, thereby freeing resources to be directed to the task at hand
    
-   People who are simultaneously challenged by a demanding cognitive task and by a temptation are more likely to yield to the temptation
    
-   System 1 has more influence on behavior when System 2 is busy
    
-   People who are cognitively busy are also more likely to make selfish choices, use sexist language, and make superficial judgments in social situations
    
-   The self-control of morning people is impaired at night
    
-   Too much concern about how well one is doing in a task sometimes disrupts performance by loading short-term memory with pointless anxious thoughts
    
-   Self-control requires attention and effort
    
-   Controlling thoughts and behaviors is one of the tasks that System 2 performs
    
-   All variants of voluntary effort—cognitive, emotional, or physical—draw at least partly on a shared pool of mental energy
    
-   An effort of will or self-control is tiring; if you have had to force yourself to do something, you are less willing or less able to exert self-control when the next challenge comes around
    
-   Ego-depleted people, therefore, succumb more quickly to the urge to quit
    
-   One of the main functions of System 2 is to monitor and control thoughts and actions 'suggested' by System 1
    
-   Many people are overconfident, prone to place too much faith in their intuitions
    
-   Most people do not take the trouble to think though the problem
    
-   When people believe a conclusion is true, they are also very likely to believe arguments that appear to support it, even when these arguments are unsound
    
-   Facts that we know do not always come to mind when we need them
    
-   Intelligence is not only the ability to reason; it is also the ability to find relevannt material in memory and to deploy attention when we needed. Memory function is an attribute of System 1
    
-   Everyone has the ooption of slowing down to confuct an active search of memory for all possibly relevant facts
    
-   The extent of deliberate checking and search is a characteristic of System 2, whichc varies among individuals
    
-   Different 'personalities.' System 1 is impulsive; System 2 is capable of reasoning, and it is cautious, but at least for some people it is also lazy
    
-   Superficial or 'lazy' thinking is a flaw in the reflective mind, a failure of rationality
    
-   Associative activation: ideas that have been evoked trigger many other ideas, in a spreading cascade of activity in your brain
    
-   Each element is connected, and each supports and strengthens the others
    
-   System 1 treated the mere conjunction of two words as representations of reality. Your body reacted in an attenuated replica of a reactionn to the real thing, and the emotional response and physical recoil were part of the interpretation of the event
    
-   Cognition is embodied; you think with your body, not only with your brain
    
-   Principles of association resemblance, contiguity in time and place, and causality
    
-   You know far less about yourself than you feel you do
    
-   Your actions and your emotions can be primed by events of which you are not even aware
    
-   Simple, common gestures unconsciously influennce our thoughts and feelings
    
-   You are likely to be rewarded by actually feeling calm and kind
    
-   Money-primed people become more independent than they would be without the associative trigger
    
-   Money-primed people are also more selfish
    
-   Participants primed by money chose to stay much farther apart than their nonprimed peers. Money-primed undergraduates also showed a greater preference for being alone
    
-   The idea of money primes individualism: a reluctance to be involved with others, to depend on others or to accept demands from others
    
-   Living in a culture that surrounds us with reminders of money may shape our behavior and our attitudes in ways that we do not know about and of which we may not be proud
    
-   Reminding people of their mortality increases the appeal of authoritarian ideas, which may become reassuring in the context of the terror of death
    
-   Feeling that one's soul is stained appears to trigger a desire to cleanse one's body
    
-   A purely symbolic reminder of being watched prodded people into improved behavior
    
-   System 1 provides the impressions that often turn into your beliefs, and is the source of the impulses that often become your choices and your actions
    
-   System 1 is also the origin of many of the systematic errors in your intuitions
    
-   Assessments are carried out automatically by System 1, and one of their functions is to determine whether extra effort is required from System 2
    
-   Cognitive strain is affected by both the current level of effort and the presence of unmet demands
    
-   When you are in a state of cognitive ease, you are probably in a good mood, like what you see, believe what you hear, trust your intuitions, and feel that the current situation is comfortably familiar
    
-   When you feel strained, you are more likely to be vigilant and suspicious, invest more effort in what you are doing, feel less comfortable, and make fewer errors, but you also are less intuitive and less creative than usual
    
-   Predictable illusions inevitably occur if a judgment is based on an impression of cognitive ease or strain. Anything that makes it easier for the associative machine to run smoothly will also bias beliefs. A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth
    
-   If your message is to be printed, use high-quality paper to maximize the contrast between characters and their background. If you use color, you are more likely to be believed if your text is printed in bright blue or red than in middling shades of green, yellow, or pale blue
    
-   If you care about being thought credible and intelligent, do not use complex language where simpler language will do
    
-   In addition to making your message simple, try to make it memorable. Put your ideas in verse if you can; they will be more likely to be taken as truth
    
-   If you quote a source, choose one with a name that is easy to pronounce
    
-   System 2 is lazy and that mental effort is aversive
    
-   The lazy System 2 will adopt the suggestions of System 1 and march on
    
-   The experience of cognitive strain, tends to mobilize System 2, shifting people's approach to problems from a casual intuitive mode to a more engaged and analytic mode
    
-   Cognitive strain mobilizes System 2, which is more likely to reject the intuitive answer suggested by System 1
    
-   We have some ability to control the search of memory, and also to program it so that the detection of an event in the environment can attract attention
    
-   The main function of System 1 is to maintain nand update a model of your personal world, which represents what is normal in it. The model is constructed by associations that link ideas of circumstances, events, actions, and outcomes that co-occur with some regularity, either at the same time or within a relatively short interval
    
-   The pattern of associated ideas comes to represent the structure of events in your life, and it determines your interpretation of the present as well as your expectations of the future
    
-   Understanding a statement must begin with an attempt to believe it: you must first know what the idea would mean if it were true. Only then can you decide whether or not to unbelieve it. The initial attempt to believe is an automatic operation of System 1, which involves the construction of the best possible interpretation of the situation
    
-   The tendency to like (or dislike) everything about a person—including things you have not observed—is known as the halo effect
    
-   To derive the most useful information from multiple sources of evidence, you should always try to make these sources independent of each other
    
-   System 1 excels at constructing the best possible story that incorporates ideas currently activated, but it does not allow for information it does not have
    
-   The combination of a coherence-seeking System 1 with a lazy System 2 implies that System 2 will endorse many intuitive beliefs, which closely reflect the impressions generated by System 1
    
-   What you see is all there is. System 1 is radically insensitive to both the quality and the quantity of the information that gives rise to impressions and intuitions
    
-   The confidence that individuals have in their beliefs depends mostly on the quality of the story they can tell about what they see, even if they see little
    
-   System 2 receives questions or generates them: in either case it directs attention and searches memory to find the answers
    
-   We are endowed with an ability to evaluate, in a single glance at a stranger's face, how dominant he is, and how trustworthy he is
    
-   The normal state of your mind is that you have intuitive feelings and opinions about almost everything that comes your way. You like or dislike people long before you know much about them; you trust or distrust strangers without knowing why
    
-   Heuristic is a simple procedure that helps find adequate, though often imperfect, answers to difficult questions
    
-   System 2 is ultimately in charge, with the ability to resist the suggestions of System 1, slow things down, and impose logical analysis. Self-criticism is one of the functions of System 2. In the context of attitudes System 2 is more of an apologist for the emotions of System 1 than a critic of those emotions—an endorser rather than an enforcer
    
-   The operation of System 2 depended on the facts and suggestoins retrieved from associative memory
    
-   Extreme outcomes (both high and low) are more likely to be found in small than in large samples
    
-   Results of large samples deserve more trust than smaller samples
    
-   Large samples are more precise than small samples
    
-   Small samples yield extreme results more often than large samples do
    
-   System 1 is not prone to doubt. It suppresses ambiguity and spontaneously constructs stories that are as coherent as possible
    
-   System 2 is capable of doubt, because it can maintain incompatible possibilities at the same tinme. Sustaining doubt is harder work than sliding into certainty
    
-   We are prone to exaggerate the consistency and coherence of what we see
    
-   We are patten seekers, believers in a coherent world, in which regularities appear not by accident but as a result of mechanical causality or of someone's intention
    
-   To the untrained eye randomness appears as regularity or tendency to cluster
    
-   We are far too willing to reject the belief that much of what we see in life is random
    
-   Small schools are not better on average; they are simply more variable
    
-   We pay more attention to the content of messages than to information about their reliability, and as a result end up with a view of the world around us that is simpler and more coherent than the data justify
    
-   Anchoring effect is when people consider a particular value for ann unknown quantity before estimating that quantity
    
-   Suggestion is a priming effect, which selectively evokes compatible evidence
    
-   System 1 understands sentences by trying to make them true
    
-   System 1 tries its best to construct a world in which the anchor is the true nature
    
-   Anchoring effects are everywhere
    
-   A strategy of deliberately 'thinking the opposite' may be a good defense against anchoring effects, because it negates the biased recruitment of thoughts that produces these effects
    
-   Our thoughts and our behavior are influenced, much more than we know or want, by the environment of the moment
    
-   You should assume that any number that is on the table has had an anchoring effect on you, and if the stakes are high you should mobilize yourself (your System 2) to combat the effect
    
-   Availability heuristic instances of the class will be retrieved from memory, and if retrieval is easy and fluent, the category will be judged to be large
    
-   People who had just listed twelve instances rated themselves as less assertive than people who had listed only six
    
-   People sometimes go by content rather than by ease of retrieval
    
-   The ease with which instances come to mind is a System 1 heuristic, which is replaced by a focus on content when System 2 is more engaged
    
-   People who let themselves be guided by System 1 are more strongly susceptible to availability biases than others who are in a state of higher vigilance
    
-   Merely reminding people of a time when they had power increases their apparent trust in their own intuition
    
-   Estimates of causes of death are warped by media coverage
    
-   People form opinions and make choices that directly express their feelings and their basic tendency to approach or avoid, other without knowing that they are doing so
    
-   The affect heuristic is an instance of substitution, in which the answer to an easy question serves as an answer to a much harder question
    
-   Don't expect discipline to be easy—it requires a significant effort of self-monitoring and self-control
    
-   You should not let yourself believe whatever comes to your mind
    
-   Your beliefs should be constrained by the logic of probability
    
-   When you specify a possible event in greater detail you can only lower its probability
    
-   Adding detail to scenarios makes them more persuasive, but less likely to come true
    
-   System 1 average instead of adding, so when the non-feminist bank tellers are removed from the set, subjective probability, increases
    
-   System 2 is not impressively alert
    
-   Individuals feel relieved of responsibility when they know that others have heard the same request for help
    
-   Subjects' unwillingness to deduce the particular from the general was matched only by their willingness to infer the general from the particular
    
-   People who are taught surprising statistical facts about human behavior may be impressed to the point of telling their friends about what they have heard, but this does not mean that their understanding of the world has really changed. The test of learning psychology is whether your understanding of situations you encounter has changed, not whether you have learned a new fact
    
-   You are more likely to learn something by finding surprises in your own behavior than by hearing surprising facts about people in general
    
-   Rewards for improved performance work better than punishment of mistakes
    
-   The feedback to which life exposes us is perverse. Because we tend to be nice to other people when they please us and nasty when they do not, we are statistically punished for being nice and rewarded for being nasty
    
-   Depressed children are an extreme group, they are more depressed than most other children—and extreme groups regress to the mean over time
    
-   You still make errors when your predictions are unbiased, but the errors are smaller and do not favor either high or low outcomes
    
-   Intuitive predictions tend to be overconfident and overly extreme
    
-   Correcting your intuitive predictions is a task for System 2
    
-   Your intuitions will deliver predictions that are too extreme and you will be inclined to put far too much faith in them
    
-   Narrative fallacies arise inevitably from our continuous attempt to make sense of the world. The explanatory stories that people find compelling are simple; are concrete rather than abstract; assign a larger role to talent, stupidity, and intentions than to luck; and focus on a few striking events that happened rather than on the countless events that failed to happen
    
-   The halo effect inclines us to match our view of all the qualities of a person to our judgment of one attribute that is particularly significant
    
-   Because of the halo effect, we get the causal relationship backward: we are prone to believe that the firm fails because its CEO is rigid, when the truth is that the CEO appears to be rigid because the firm is failing
    
-   System 1 is designed to jump to conclusions from little evidence
    
-   Confidence is a feeling, which reflects the coherence of the information and the cognitive ease of processing it
    
-   On average, the most active traders had the poorest results, while the investors who traded the least earned the highest returns
    
-   The potent psychological cause of the illusion is certainly that the people who pick stocks are exercising high-level skills
    
-   The illusions of validity and skill are supported by a powerful professional culture. People can maintain an unshakable faith in any proposition, however absurd, when they are sustained by a community of like-minded believers
    
-   Our tendency to construct and believe coherent narratives of the past makes it difficult for us to accept the limits of our forecasting ability
    
-   The illusion that we understand the past fosters overconfidence in our ability to predict the future
    
-   The person who acquires more knowledge develops an enhanced illusion of her skill and becomes unrealistically overconfident
    
-   Experts are just human in the end. They are dazzled by their own brilliance and hate to be wrong. Experts are led astray not by what they believe, but by how they thinnk
    
-   Errors of prediction are inevitable because the world is predictable. The high subjective confidence is not to be trusted as an indicator of accuracy (low confidence could be more informative)
    
-   Experts try to be clever, think outside the box, and consider complex combinations of features in making their predictions. Complexity combinations of features are better
    
-   Humans are incorrigibly inconsistent in making summary judgments of complex information
    
-   Unnoticed stimuli in nour environment have a substantial influence on our thoughts and actions
    
-   Because you have little direct knowledge of what goes on in your mind, you will never know that you might have made a different judgment or reached a different decision under very slightly different circumstances
    
-   To maximize predictive accuracy, final decisions should be left to formulas, especially in low-validity environments
    
-   Do not simply trust intuitive judgment but do not dismiss it, either
    
-   Supposed that you need to hire a sales representative for your firm. If you are serious about hiring the best possible person for the job, this is what you should do. First, select a few traits that are prerequisites for success in this position. Next, make a list of those questions for each trait and think about how you will score it, say on a 1-5 scale
    
-   To avoid halo effects, you must collect the information on one trait at a time, scoring each before you move on to the next one. Do not skip around. To evaluate each candidate, add up the six scores
    
-   We have inherited from our ancestors a great facility to learn when to be afraid
    
-   We are confident when the story we tell ourselves comes easily to mind, with no contradiction and no competing scenario
    
-   The confidence that people have in their intuitions is not a reliable guide to their validity
    
-   Intuition cannot be trusted in the absence of stable regularities in the environment
    
-   Whether professionals have a chance to develop intuitive expertise depends essentially on the quality and speed of feedback, as well as on sufficient opportunity to practice
    
-   Expertise is not a single skill; it is a collection of skills
    
-   The proper way to elicit information from a group is not by starting with a public discussion but by confidentially collecting each person's judgment
    
-   Planning fallacy describe plans and forecasts that are unrealistically close to best-case scenarios and could be improved by consulting the statistics of similar cases
    
-   Contractors of kitchen renovations and of weapons systems readily admit that they routinely make most of their profits on additions to the original plan
    
-   People often take on risky projects because they are overly optimistic about the odds they face
    
-   Most of us view the world as more benign than it really is, our own attributes as more favorable than they truly are, and the goals we adopt as more achievable than they are likely to be. We also tend to exaggerate our ability to forcast the future, which fosters optimistic overconfidence
    
-   Optimists are normally cheerful and happy, and therefore popular; they are resilient in adapting to failures and hardships, their chances of clinical depression are reduced, their immune system is stronger, they take better care of their health, they feel healthier than others and are in fact likely to live longer
    
-   People achieve higher average returns by selling their skills to employers than by setting out on their own
    
-   Firms with award-winning CEOs subsequently underperform, in terms both of stock and of operating performance
    
-   Imagine that we are a year into the future. We implemented the plan as it now exists. The outcome was a disaster. Please take 5 to 10 minutes to write a brief history of that disaster
    
-   Unlike Econs, the Humans that psychologists know have a System 1. Their view of the world is limited by the information that is available at a given moment, and therefore they cannot be as consistent and logical as Econs. They are sometimes generous and often willing to contribute to the group to which they are attached. And they often have little idea of what they will like next year or even tomorrow
    
-   Bad emotions, bad parents, and bad feedback have more impact than good ones, and bad information is processed more thoroughly than good. The self is more motivated to avoid bad self-definitions than to pursue good ones. Bad impressions and bad stereotypes are quicker to form and more resistant to disconfirmation than good ones
    
-   A stable relationship requires that good interactions outnumber bad interactions by at least 5 to 1
    
-   A friendship that may take years to develop can be ruined by a single action
    
-   Loss aversion refers to the relative strength of two motives: we are driven more strongly to avoid losses than to achieve gains
    
-   The aversion to the failure of not reaching the goal is much stronger than the desire to exceed it
    
-   Employers who violate rules of fairness are punished by reduced productivity, and merchants who follow unfair pricing policies can expect to lose sales
    
-   People who learned from a new catalog that the merchant was now chargin less for a product that they had recently bought at a higher price reduced their future purchases from the supplier by 15%, an average loss of $90 per customer. The customers evidently perceived the lower price as the reference point and thought of themselves as having sustained a loss by paying more than appropriate
    
-   When an unlikely event becomes the focus of attention, we will assign it much more weight than nits probability deserves
    
-   When you pay attention to a threat, you worry—and the decision weights reflect how much you worry
    
-   People attach values to gains and losses rather than to wealth, and the decision weights that they assign to outcomes are different from probabilities
    
-   People are averse to risk when they consider prospects with a substaintial chance to achieve a large gain. They are willing to accept less than the expected value of a gamble to lock in a sure gain
    
-   People are willing to pay much more for insurannce than expected value
    
-   People buy more protection against an unlikely disaster; they eliminate a worry and purchase peace of mind
    
-   People who face very bad optionns take desperate gambles, accepting a high probability of making things worse in exchange for a small hope of avoiding a large loss.
    
-   The thought of accepting the large sure loss is too painful, annd the hope of complete relief too enticinng, to make the sensible decision that it is time to cut one's losses
    
-   Consistent overweightinng of improbable outcomes eventually leads to inferior outcomes
    
-   The more vivid description produces a higher decision weight for the same probability
    
-   Chances of rare evennts receive less impact than they deserve according to their objective probabilities
    
-   Obsessive concerns, vivid images, concrete representations and explicit reminders all contribute to overweighting
    
-   The emotional evaluation of 'sure gain' and 'sure loss' is an automatic reaction of System 1
    
-   It is costly to be risk averse for gains and risk seeking for losses
    
-   Playing a very favorable but risky gamble multiple times reduces the subjective risk
    
-   The combinnation of loss aversion and narrow framing is a costly curse. Individual investors can avoid that curse, achieving the emotionnal benefits of braod framing while also saving time and agony, by reducing the frequenccy with which they check how well their innvestments are doing. Closely following daily fluctuations is a losing proposition, because the pain of the frequent small losses exceeds the pleasure of the equally frequent small gainns
    
-   A commitment not to change one's posiitons for several periods improves financial performance
    
-   In the United States realizing losses reduces your taxes, while selling winners exposes you to taxes
    
-   A rational decision maker is interested onnly in the future consequences of current investments
    
-   The decision to invest additional resources in na losing account, when better investments are available, is known as the sunk-cost fallacy
    
-   The sunk-cost fallacy keeps people for too long in poor jobs, unhappy marriages, and unpromising research projects
    
-   People expect to have stronger emotional reactions to an outcome that is produced by action than to the same outcome when it is produced by inaction
    
-   A bad outcome is much more acceptable if it is framed as the cost of a lottery ticket that did nont winn than if it is simply described as losing a gamble. Losses evokes stronger negative feelings than costs
    
-   People will more readily forgo a disccount than pay a surcharge. The two may be economically equivalent, but they are not emotionally equivalent
    
-   Reframing is effortful and System 2 is normally lazy. Unless there is an obvios reasont o do otherwise, most of us passively accept decision problems as they are framed and therefore rarely have an opportunity to discover the extent to which our preferences are frame-bound rather than reality-bounnd
    
-   Decision makers tend to prefer the sure thing over the gamble when the outcomes are good. They tend to reject the sure thing and accept the gamble when both outcomes are negative
    
-   'Nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure. It is for them alone to poinnt out what we ought too do, as well as to determine what we shall do.' - Jeremy Bentham
    
-   The photographer does not view the scene as a moment to be savored but as a future memory to be designed.
    
-   Picture taking is not necessarily the best way for the tourists experiencing self to enjoy a view
    
-   A person cannnot live nnormally while constantly reporting her experiences
    
-   Our emotional state is largely determined by what we attend to, and we are normally focused onn our current activity and immediate environemt. There are exceptions, where the quality of subjective experience is dominated by recurrent thoughts rahter than by the events of the moment
    
-   To get pleasure from eating, you must notice that you are doing it
    
-   Americans were far more prone to combine eating with other activities, and their pleasure from eating was correspondingly diluted
    
-   The second best predictor of the feelings of a day is whether a person did or did not have contacts with friends or relatives
    
-   More educationn is associated with higher evalution of one's life, but nont with greater experienced well-being
    
-   In the UnitedStates, the more educated tend to report higher stress. Ill health has a much stronger adverse effect on experienced well-being than on life evaluation. Livinng with children also imposes a significant cost in the currency of daily feelings, but the adverse effects on life evaluation are smaller. Religious participation also has relatively greater favorable impact on both positive affect and stress reduction than non life evaluation. Religion provides no reduction of feelings of depression or worry
    
-   Being poor makes one miserable, and that being rich may enhance one's life satisfaction, but does not improve experienced well-being
    
-   Illness is much worse for the very poor than for those who are more comfortable
    
-   The beneficial effeccts of the weekend on experienced well-being are significantly smaller for the very poor than for most everyone else
    
-   The satiation level beyond which experienced well-being no lonnger increases was a houshold income of about $75,000 inn high-cost areas
    
-   Higher inccome is associated with a reduced ability to enjoy the samll pleasures of life
    
-   Priming students with the idea of wealth reduces the pleasure their face expresses as they eat a bar of chocolate
    
-   Goals make a large difference
    
-   One recipe for a dissatisfied adulthood is setting goals that are especially difficult to attain
    
-   Tennagers goals innfluenncce what happens to them, where they ennd up, and how satisfied they are
    
-   Anny aspect of life to which attention is directed will loom large in a global evaluation
    
-   Focusing illusion: Nothing in life is an important as you think it is when you are thinking about it
    
-   Your mood is determined by whatever you think about
    
-   The focusing illusion can cause people to be wronng about their present state of well-being as well as about the happiness of others, and about their own happiness in the future
    
-   Depression involves a self-reinforcing cycle of miserable thoughts
    
-   Intuitive System 1, does the fast thinking, effortful and slower System 2, does the slow thinkinng, monitors System 1, and maintains control as best it can within its limited resources. The fictitous Econs, live in the land of theory, the Humans, act in the real world. The experienncing self, does the living, the remembering self, keeps score and makes the choices
    
-   It does nnot make sense to evaluate an entire life by its last moments, or to give no weight to duration inn deciding which life is more desirable
    
-   The central fact of our existence is that time is the ultimate finite resource, but the remembering self ignores that reality
    
-   The perspective of the remembering self is not always correct
    
-   It is a good bet that many of the things we say we will always remember will be long forgotten tenn years later
    
-   Individuals identify with their remembering self and care about their story
    
-   Rationality is logical coherence—reasonable or not
    
-   Do not interfere with the individual's right to choose, unless the choices harm others
    
-   When we observe people accting inn ways that seem odd, we should first examine the possibility that they have a good reason to do what they do
    
-   The acquisition of skills requires a regular environment, an adequate opportunity to practice, and rapid and unequivocal feedback about the correctness of thoughts and actions

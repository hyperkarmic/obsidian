# Robin Sharma - The Monk Who Sold Me His Ferrari
### Parker Klein Notes
-   Ignore the real world
    
-   The real world is an excuse. A justification for not trying
    
-   Learn from your successes
    
-   Planning is guessing
    
-   Build off what works
    
-   Start referring to all of your plans as guesses. That is what they are since most of them are out of your control. It takes a lot of pressure off
    
-   You have to be able to improvise, not be driven by the past, pick up opportunities as they come along. Sometimes you need to say we are going in a new direction because that is what makes sense today
    
-   You have the most information while you are doing something
    
-   Figure out the next most important thing you need to do and do that
    
-   Grow slow and do what feels right
    
-   Workaholics aren't the heroes. The heroes are already home because they figured out a faster way to get something done
    
-   Go make a dent in the universe
    
-   What you do is your legacy
    
-   If you are going to do something, do something that matters
    
-   Scratch your own itch. Solve your own problem
    
-   Solving your own problem allows you to fall in love with your product
    
-   What you do is what matters
    
-   Starting is the most important step
    
-   When you want something bad enough, you make the time, regardless of other obligations
    
-   It is entirely your responsibility to make your dreams come true
    
-   The time will never be perfect
    
-   When you get going, keep in mind why you do what you do
    
-   Great companies have a point of view. Not just a product
    
-   Your point of view will turn some people off. That is life
    
-   If no one is upset by what you are saying, you probably aren't pushing hard enough
    
-   When you don't know what you stand for, decisions are hard. When you do, decisions are easy
    
-   You give up control when you accept outsider money
    
-   Just focus on what you are building
    
-   You need less than you think
    
-   Great companies start in garages all the time
    
-   Start a business, not a startup
    
-   You need a commitment strategy, not an exit strategy
    
-   It's easier to change your mind when you have less mass
    
-   Get creative. You'll be amazed what you can make with so little
    
-   Build half a product, not a half assed product
    
-   Ignore the details early on
    
-   Use a sharpie to draw out new ideas. Then you can only worry about the main things, not the details
    
-   Commit to making decisions. Decide and move forward
    
-   What can we easily do right now that is good enough?
    
-   If you make a mistake, you can correctly it later
    
-   Constantly look for things you can remove, simplify, and streamline
    
-   Do less
    
-   You don't need the best tools and equipment to be good or to get started
    
-   Sell your byproducts
    
-   Launch now
    
-   Start making something real. Anything else is a distraction
    
-   Questions to ask yourself to make sure you are doing work that matters: Why are you doing this? What is it for? Who benefits? What problem are you solving? Is this actually useful? Are you adding value? Is what you are working on actually adding value for customers? Will this change behavior? Is there an easier way? What could you be doing instead? Is it really worth it? Is it worth spending your time, money, and energy on?
    
-   Interruption is the enemy of productivity
    
-   Good enough is fine
    
-   Judo solution: get the most out of doing the least
    
-   You can usually turn good enough into great later
    
-   Momentum fuels motivation
    
-   If you aren't motivated by what you are doing, it won't be any good
    
-   Small victories lead to enthusiasm and good news
    
-   Ask yourself, 'what can we do in two weeks?' and then do it
    
-   The quicker it is in the hands of customers, the better off you'll be
    
-   Creativity is one of the first things to go when you forgo sleep. Go to sleep
    
-   When you are tired, you lose the ability to tackle the big problems
    
-   Make smaller to-do lists
    
-   Breakdown big projects into smaller tasks
    
-   Make decisions small enough that you can change your mind and go in a different direction
    
-   Don't copy. It skips understanding, and understanding is how you grow
    
-   Be influenced, but don't steal
    
-   Make you part of what you sell
    
-   Pick a fight. If you think a competitor sucks, say it
    
-   Simplify and solve the simple problems
    
-   When you spend time worrying about someone else, you can't spend that time improving yourself
    
-   Highlight that your service does less
    
-   Redefine the rules. Don't just make something a little bit better
    
-   Say 'no' by default. You will avoid a lot of long term regret by refusing things you don't prioritize to start
    
-   Allow customers to grow out of your product
    
-   Scaring away new customers is worse than losing old customers
    
-   Take risks when a lot of people don't know about you
    
-   Build an audience
    
-   Out teach your competition
    
-   Share everything you know. Give people a backstage pass and show them how your business works. People want to know how and why people make decisions. They will develop a deeper respect of how and what you do. Show people your imperfections
    
-   Marketing is everything you do
    
-   Nobody cares about you
    
-   Own your bad news. If something bad happens, tell your customers. An 'I' apology is more powerful than a 'We' apology
    
-   You don't create a culture. It happens. Culture is the byproduct of consistent behavior. Culture is action, not words
    
-   Decisions are temporary. Optimize for now and worry about the future later
    
-   People are waiting to do great work, they just need to be given the chance
    
-   Failing to trust employees is expensive
    
-   If you want to get something done, ask the busiest person you know
    
-   Don't create policies. Just address an issues personally
    
-   Sound like you. Don't be afraid to be you. Talk about making money and being honest. Use simple talk. to be read. Forget rules. Communicate. Write like you are talking to one person. Think about one person when you are writing
    
-   Don't use: need, must, can't, just, only, fast, easy, or ASAP

## Think And Grow Rich - Napoleon Hill

### Parker Klein Notes
-   There is no such thing as SOMETHING FOR NOTHING!
    
-   Riches are not beyond your reach
    
-   Money, fame, recognition and happiness can be had by all who are ready and determined to have these blessings
    
-   ALL ACHIEVEMENT, ALL EARNED RICHES, HAVE THEIR BEGINNING IN AN IDEA!
    
-   If you are ready for the secret, you already possess one half of it, therefore, you will readily recognize the other half the moment it reaches your mind.
    
-   Thoughts are things
    
-   TRULY, 'thoughts are things,' and powerful things at that, when they are mixed with definiteness of purpose, persistence, and a BURNING DESIRE for their translation into riches, or other material objects
    
-   Be determined to get what you come for
    
-   When a man really DESIRES a thing so deeply that he is willing to stake his entire future on a single turn of the wheel in order to get it, he is sure to win
    
-   What young Barnes said to Mr. Edison on that occasion was far less important than that which he thought
    
-   It was what he THOUGHT that counted
    
-   When one is truly ready for a thing, it puts in its appearance
    
-   DETERMINED TO REMAIN READY UNTIL HE GOT THAT WHICH HE WAS SEEKING
    
-   Adopt a DEFINITE PURPOSE, and stand by that purpose until it had time to become an all-consuming obsession!
    
-   His bulldog determination, his persistence in standing back of a single DESIRE, was destined to mow down all opposition, and bring him the opportunity he was seeking
    
-   That is one of the tricks of opportunity. It has a sly habit of slipping in by the back door, and often it comes disguised in the form of misfortune, or temporary defeat. Perhaps this is why so many fail to recognize opportunity
    
-   KNOW WHAT HE WANTED, AND THE DETERMINATION TO STAND BY THAT DESIRE UNTIL HE REALIZED IT
    
-   Have initiative, faith, and the will to win
    
-   One of the most common causes of failure is the habit of quitting when one is overtaken by temporary defeat
    
-   Seek expert counsel before giving up
    
-   DESIRE can be transmuted into gold
    
-   Never stop because men say 'no'
    
-   Before success comes in any man's life, he is sure to meet with much temporary defeat, and, perhaps, some failure. When defeat overtakes a man, the easiest and most logical thing to do is to QUIT. That is exactly what the majority of men do
    
-   Greatest success came just one step beyond the point at which defeat had overtaken them. Failure is a trickster with a keen sense of irony and cunning
    
-   'No' does not necessarily mean no
    
-   Keep on keeping on, no matter how hard the going may be, a lesson I needed to learn before I could succeed in anything
    
-   One sound idea is all that one needs to achieve success
    
-   WHEN RICHES BEGIN TO COME THEY COME SO QUICKLY, IN SUCH GREAT ABUNDANCE, THAT ONE WONDERS WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN HIDING DURING ALL THOSE LEAN YEARS
    
-   Riches begin with a state of mind, with definiteness of purpose, with little or no hard work
    
-   Success comes to those who become SUCCESS CONSCIOUS
    
-   Failure comes to those who indifferently allow themselves to become FAILURE CONSCIOUS
    
-   We refuse to believe that which we do not understand. We foolishly believe that our own limitations are the proper measure of limitations
    
-   DESIRE: knowing what one wants
    
-   YOU ARE 'THE MASTER OF YOUR FATE, THE CAPTAIN OF YOUR SOUL
    
-   We are the Masters of our Fate, the Captains of our Souls, because we have the power to control our thoughts
    
-   The ether in which this little earth floats, in which we move and have our being, is a form of energy moving at an inconceivably high rate of vibration, and that the ether is filled with a form of universal power which ADAPTS itself to the nature of the thoughts we hold in our minds; and INFLUENCES us, in natural ways, to transmute our thoughts into their physical equivalent.
    
-   Our brains become magnetized with the dominating thoughts which we hold in our minds, and, by means with which no man is familiar, these 'magnets' attract to us the forces, the people, the circumstances of life which harmonize with the nature of our dominating thoughts
    
-   Before we can accumulate riches in great abundance, we must magnetize our minds with intense DESIRE for riches, that we must become 'money conscious until the DESIRE for money drives us to create definite plans for acquiring it
    
-   Maintain a spirit of open-mindedness
    
-   He saw himself
    
-   He heard himself asking Mr. Edison for an opportunity to carry out the one CONSUMING OBSESSION OF HIS LIFE, a BURNING DESIRE to become the business associate of the great inventor
    
-   It was a keen, pulsating DESIRE, which transcended everything else. It was DEFINITE
    
-   He chose a definite goal, placed all his energy, all his will power, all his effort, everything back of that goal
    
-   HE WAS THE PARTNER OF EDISON EVERY MINUTE OF THE TIME, from the very day that he first went to work there
    
-   Every person who wins in any undertaking must be willing to burn his ships and cut all sources of retreat. Only by so doing can one be sure of maintaining that state of mind known as a BURNING DESIRE TO WIN, essential to success
    
-   Six steps of desire
    
-   Wishing will not bring riches. But desiring riches with a state of mind that becomes an obsession, then planning definite ways and means to acquire riches, and backing those plans with persistence which does not recognize failure, will bring riches
    
-   1. Fix in your mind the exact amount of money you desire. Be definite as to the amount
    
-   2. Determine exactly what you intend to give in return for the money you desire
    
-   3. Establish a definite date when you intend to possess the money you desire
    
-   4. Create a definite plan for carrying out your desire, and begin at once, whether you are ready or not, to put this plan into action
    
-   5. Write out a clear, concise statement of the amount of money you intend to acquire, name the time limit for its acquisition, state what you intend to give in return for the money, and describe clearly the plan through which you intend to accumulate it
    
-   6. Read your written statement aloud, twice daily, once just before retiring at night, and once after arising in the morning. AS YOU READ-SEE AND FEEL AND BELIEVE YOURSELF ALREADY IN POSSESSION OF THE MONEY
    
-   The successful application of these six steps does call for sufficient imagination to enable one to see, and to understand, that accumulation of money cannot be left to chance, good fortune, and luck. One must realize that all who have accumulated great fortunes, first did a certain amount of dreaming, hoping, wishing, DESIRING, and PLANNING before they acquired money
    
-   You can never have riches in great quantities, UNLESS you can work yourself into a white heat of DESIRE for money, and actually BELIEVE you will possess it
    
-   Every great leader, from the dawn of civilization down to the present, was a dreamer
    
-   If you do not see great riches in your imagination, you will never see them in your bank balance
    
-   DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE, the knowledge of what one wants, and a burning DESIRE to possess it
    
-   The practical dreamers have always been, and always will be the pattern-makers of civilization
    
-   If the thing you wish to do is right, and you believe in it, go ahead and do it!
    
-   The greatest achievement was, at first, and for a time, but a dream
    
-   Kindle anew in your mind the fire of hope, faith, courage, and tolerance
    
-   There is a difference between WISHING for a thing and being READY to receive it. No one is ready for a thing, until he believes he can acquire it. The state of mind must be BELIEF, not mere hope or wish. Open-mindedness is essential for belief. Closed minds do not inspire faith, courage, and belief
    
-   No more effort is required to aim high in life, to demand abundance and prosperity, than is required to accept misery and poverty
    
-   The whole course of things goes to teach us faith. We need only obey. There is guidance for each of us, and by lowly listening, we shall hear the right word
    
-   Our only limitations are those we set up in our own minds
    
-   DESIRE BACKED BY FAITH knows no such word as impossible
    
-   EVERY ADVERSITY BRINGS WITH IT THE SEED OF AN EQUIVALENT ADVANTAGE
    
-   Sell yourself on good ideas
    
-   Nothing is impossible to the person who backs DESIRE with enduring FAITH
    
-   Don't make the mistake of condemning genius without giving it an opportunity
    
-   FAITH is the head chemist of the mind
    
-   The emotions of FAITH, LOVE, and SEX are the most powerful of all the major positive emotions
    
-   Repetition of affirmation of orders to your subconscious mind is the only known method of voluntary development of the emotion of faith
    
-   ALL THOUGHTS WHICH HAVE BEEN EMOTIONALIZED, (given feeling) AND MIXED WITH FAITH, begin immediately to translate themselves into their physical equivalent or counterpart
    
-   The subconscious mind will translate into its physical equivalent, a thought impulse of a negative or destructive nature, just as readily as it will act upon thought impulses of a positive or constructive nature
    
-   Conduct yourself just as you would, if you were ALREADY IN POSSESSION OF THE MATERIAL THING WHICH YOU ARE DEMANDING, when you call upon your subconscious mind
    
-   Perfection will come through practice. It cannot come by merely reading instructions
    
-   One may develop faith by voluntarily suggesting to the subconscious mind that one has faith. The mind comes, finally, to take on the nature of the influences which dominate it
    
-   FAITH IS A STATE OF MIND WHICH MAY BE INDUCED BY AUTOSUGGESTION
    
-   Have Faith in yourself; Faith in the Infinite
    
-   FAITH is the 'eternal elixir' which gives life, power, and action to the impulse of though
    
-   FAITH is the starting point of all accumulation of riches! FAITH is the basis of all 'miracles,' and all mysteries which cannot be analyzed by the rules of science! FAITH is the only known antidote for FAILURE! FAITH is the element, the 'chemical' which, when mixed with prayer, gives one direct communication with Infinite Intelligence. FAITH is the element which transforms the ordinary vibration of thought, created by the finite mind of man, into the spiritual equivalent. FAITH is the only agency through which the cosmic force of Infinite Intelligence can be harnessed and used by man
    
-   One comes, finally, to BELIEVE whatever one repeats to one's self, whether the statement be true or false
    
-   Every man is what he is, because of the DOMINATING THOUGHTS which he permits to occupy his mind
    
-   THOUGHTS WHICH ARE MIXED WITH ANY OF THE FEELINGS OF EMOTIONS, CONSTITUTE A 'MAGNETIC' FORCE WHICH ATTRACTS, FROM THE VIBRATIONS OF THE ETHER, OTHER SIMILAR, OR RELATED THOUGHTS
    
-   From the great storehouse of the ether, the human mind is constantly attracting vibrations which harmonize with that which DOMINATES the human mind. Any thought, idea, plan, or purpose which one holds in one's mind attracts, from the vibrations of the ether, a host of its relatives, adds these 'relatives' to its own force, and grows until it becomes the dominating, MOTIVATING MASTER of the individual in whose mind it has been housed
    
-   Any idea, plan, or purpose may be placed in the mind through repetition of thought
    
-   Write out a statement of your major purpose, or Definite Chief Aim, commit it to memory, and repeat it, in audible words, day after day, until these vibrations of sound have reached your subconscious mind
    
-   We are what we are, because of the vibrations of thought which we pick up and register, through the stimuli of our daily environment
    
-   Resolve to throw off the influences of any unfortunate environment, and to build your own life to ORDER. Taking inventory of mental assets and liabilities, you will discover that your greatest weakness is lack of self-confidence. This handicap can be surmounted, and timidity translated into courage, through the aid of the principle of autosuggestion. The application of this principle may be made through a simple arrangement of positive thought impulses stated in writing, memorized, and repeated, until they become a part of the working equipment of the subconscious faculty of your mind
    
-   1. I know that I have the ability to achieve the object of my Definite Purpose in life, therefore, I DEMAND of myself persistent, continuous action toward its attainment, and I here and now promise to render such action
    
-   SELF-CONFIDENCE FORMULA
    
-   2. I realize the dominating thoughts of my mind will eventually reproduce themselves in outward, physical action, and gradually transform themselves into physical reality, therefore, I will concentrate my thoughts for thirty minutes daily, upon the task of thinking of the person I intend to become, thereby creating in my mind a clear mental picture of that person
    
-   I will succeed by attracting to myself the forces I wish to use, and the cooperation of other people. I will induce others to serve me, because of my willingness to serve others. I will eliminate hatred, envy, jealousy, selfishness, and cynicism, by developing love for all humanity, because I know that a negative attitude toward others can never bring me success. I will cause others to believe in me, because I will believe in them, and in myself
    
-   The subconscious mind makes no distinction between constructive and destructive thought impulses
    
-   1. Create an idea with your imagination 2. Mix faith with your idea 3. formulate a plan for the transformation of your idea into physical and financial reality 4. Put your plan into action 5. follow-through on your plan with persistence and back it with a firm decision until it has been fully carried out 6. prepare the way for success by a burning desire for success
    
-   THERE ARE NO LIMITATIONS TO THE MIND EXCEPT THOSE WE ACKNOWLEDGE
    
-   BOTH POVERTY AND RICHES ARE THE OFFSPRING OF THOUGHT
    
-   AUTO-SUGGESTION is a term which applies to all suggestions and all self-administered stimuli which reach one's mind through the five senses
    
-   Day by day, in every way, I am getting better and better
    
-   All sense impressions which are perceived through the five senses, are stopped by the CONSCIOUS thinking mind, and may be either passed on to the subconscious mind, or rejected, at will
    
-   Nature has so built man that he has ABSOLUTE CONTROL over the material which reaches his subconscious mind, through his five senses
    
-   Your subconscious mind recognizes and acts upon ONLY thoughts which have been well-mixed with emotion or feeling
    
-   You, and YOU ALONE, must decide whether or not the reward for which you are striving (the 'money consciousness'), is worth the price you must pay for it in effort
    
-   If you try and fail, make another effort, and still another, until you succeed
    
-   Your ability to use the principle of auto-suggestion will depend, very largely, upon your capacity to CONCENTRATE upon a given DESIRE until that desire becomes a BURNING OBSESSION
    
-   Hold your thoughts on that amount of money by CONCENTRATION, or fixation of attention, with your eyes closed, until you can ACTUALLY SEE the physical appearance of the money
    
-   The subconscious mind takes any orders given it in a spirit of absolute FAITH, and acts upon those orders, although the orders often have to be presented over and over again, through repetition, before they are interpreted by the subconscious mind
    
-   Playing a perfectly legitimate 'trick' on your subconscious mind, by making it believe, because you believe it, that you must have the amount of money you are visualizing, that this money is already awaiting your claim, that the subconscious mind MUST hand over to you practical plans for acquiring the money which is yours
    
-   See what your imagination can, or will do, to create practical plans for the accumulation of money through transmutation of your desire
    
-   DO NOT WAIT for a definite plan, through which you intend to exchange services or merchandise in return for the money you are visualizing, but begin at once to see yourself in possession of the money, DEMANDING and EXPECTING meanwhile, that your subconscious mind will hand over the plan, or plans you need. Be on the alert for these plans, and when they appear, put them into ACTION IMMEDIATELY. When the plans appear, they will probably 'flash' into your mind through the sixth sense, in the form of an 'inspiration.' This inspiration may be considered a direct 'telegram,' or message from Infinite Intelligence. Treat it with respect, and act upon it as soon as you receive it. Failure to do this will be FATAL to your success
    
-   SEE YOURSELF ALREADY IN POSSESSION OF THE MONEY
    
-   FAITH is the strongest, and most productive of the emotions
    
-   Man is the master of his own earthly destiny
    
-   Man may become the master of himself, and of his environment, because he has the POWER TO INFLUENCE HIS OWN SUBCONSCIOUS MIND, and through it, gain the cooperation of Infinite Intelligence.
    
-   Man can create anything which he can imagine
    
-   The imagination is literally the workshop wherein are fashioned all plans created by man. The impulse, the DESIRE, is given shape, form, and ACTION through the aid of the imaginative faculty of the mind
    
-   MAN'S ONLY LIMITATION, within reason, LIES IN HIS DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF HIS IMAGINATION
    
-   Ideas are the beginning points of all fortunes. Ideas are products of the imagination
    
-   Thoughts are things, and their scope of operation is the world, itself
    
-   The only limitation is that which one sets up in one's own mind
    
-   DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE is the starting point from which one must begin
    
-   God seems to throw Himself on the side of the man who knows exactly what he wants
    
-   IDEAS CAN BE TRANSMUTED INTO CASH THROUGH THE POWER OF DEFINITE PURPOSE, PLUS DEFINITE PLANS
    
-   Riches, when they come in huge quantities, are never the result of HARD work! Riches come, if they come at all, in response to definite demands, based upon the application of definite principles, and not by chance or luck
    
-   An idea is an impulse of thought that impels action, by an appeal to the imagination
    
-   The creator of ideas makes his own price, and, if he is smart, gets it
    
-   The story of practically every great fortune starts with the day when a creator of ideas and a seller of ideas got together and worked in harmony
    
-   Ideas are intangible forces, but they have more power than the physical brains that give birth to them. They have the power to live on, after the brain that creates them has returned to dust
    
-   Do unto others as you would have others do unto you
    
-   Everything man creates or acquires, begins in the form of DESIRE, that desire is taken on the first lap of its journey, from the abstract to the concrete, into the workshop of the IMAGINATION, where PLANS for its transition are created and organized
    
-   Ally yourself with a group of as many people as you may need for the creation, and carrying out of your plan, or plans for the accumulation of money-making
    
-   Decide what advantages, and benefits, you may offer the individual embers of your group, in return for their cooperation.
    
-   Keep this fact in mind, and remember when your plans fail, that temporary defeat is not permanent failure
    
-   Temporary defeat should mean only one thing, the certain knowledge that there is something wrong with your plan
    
-   No man is ever whipped, until he QUITS-in his own mind
    
-   When defeat comes, accept it as a signal that your plans are not sound, rebuild those plans, and set sail once more toward your coveted goal. If you give up before your goal has been reached, you are a 'quitter.'
    
-   A QUITTER NEVER WINS-AND-A WINNER NEVER QUITS
    
-   The man who can follow a leader most efficiently, is usually the man who develops into leadership most rapidly
    
-   An intelligent follower has many advantages, among them the OPPORTUNITY TO ACQUIRE KNOWLEDGE FROM HIS LEADER
    
-   THE MAJOR ATTRIBUTES OF LEADERSHIP
    
-   1. UNWAVERING COURAGE based upon knowledge of self, and of one's occupation. No follower wishes to be dominated by a leader who lacks self-confidence and courage. No intelligent follower will be dominated by such a leader very long
    
-   2. SELF-CONTROL. The man who cannot control himself, can never control others. Self-control sets a mighty example for one's followers, which the more intelligent will emulate
    
-   3. A KEEN SENSE OF JUSTICE. Without a sense of fairness and justice, no leader can command and retain the respect of his followers
    
-   4. DEFINITENESS OF DECISION. The man who wavers in his decisions, shows that he is not sure of himself. He cannot lead others successfully
    
-   5. DEFINITENESS OF PLANS. The successful leader must plan his work, and work his plan. A leader who moves by guesswork, without practical, definite plans, is comparable to a ship without a rudder. Sooner or later he will land on the rocks
    
-   6. THE HABIT OF DOING MORE THAN PAID FOR. One of the penalties of leadership is the necessity of willingness, upon the part of the leader, to do more than he requires of his followers
    
-   7. A PLEASING PERSONALITY. No slovenly, careless person can become a successful leader. Leadership calls for respect. Followers will not respect a leader who does not grade high on all of the factors of a Pleasing Personality
    
-   8. SYMPATHY AND UNDERSTANDING. The successful leader must be in sympathy with his followers. Moreover, he must understand them and their problems
    
-   9. MASTERY OF DETAIL. Successful leadership calls for mastery of details of the leader's position
    
-   10. WILLINGNESS TO ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY. The successful leader must be willing to assume responsibility for the mistakes and the shortcomings of his followers. If he tries to shift this responsibility, he will not remain the leader. If one of his followers makes a mistake, and shows himself incompetent, the leader must consider that it is he who failed
    
-   11. COOPERATION. The successful leader must understand, and apply the principle of cooperative effort and be able to induce his followers to do the same. Leadership calls for POWER, and power calls for COOPERATION. There are two forms of Leadership. The first, and by far the most effective, is LEADERSHIP BY CONSENT of, and with the sympathy of the followers. The second is LEADERSHIP BY FORCE, without the consent and sympathy of the followers
    
-   Trulygreatleadersare willing, when occasion demands, to perform any sort of labor which they would ask another to perform. 'The greatest among ye shall be the servant of all' is a truth which all able leaders observe and respect
    
-   The world does not pay men for that which they 'know.' It pays them for what they DO, or induce others to do
    
-   The leader who fears that one of his followers may take his position is practically sure to realize that fear sooner or later
    
-   men receive more pay for their ABILITY TO GET OTHERS TO PERFORM, than they could possibly earn by their own efforts
    
-   The really great leader CLAIMS NONE OF THE HONORS. He is contented to see the honors, when there are any, go to his followers, because he knows that most men will work harder for commendation and recognition than they will for money alone.
    
-   The efficient leader leads by encouraging, and not by trying to instill fear in the hearts of his followers
    
-   It is not the lawyer who knows the most law, but the one who best prepares his case, who wins. If your 'case' is properly prepared and presented, your victory will have been more than half won at the outset
    
-   Decide EXACTLY what kind of a job you want. If the job doesn't already exist, perhaps you can create it
    
-   Choose the company, or individual for whom you wish to work
    
-   Study your prospective employer, as to policies, personnel, and chances of advancement
    
-   By analysis of yourself, your talents and capabilities, figure WHAT YOU CAN OFFER, and plan ways and means of giving advantages, services, developments, ideas that you believe you can successfully deliver
    
-   Every company is looking for men who can give something of value, whether it be ideas, services, or 'con-nections.' Every company has room for the man who has a definite plan of action which is to the advantage of that company
    
-   Every person who starts, or 'gets in' half way up the ladder, does so by deliberate and careful planning
    
-   Both the employer and his employee are EMPLOYED BY THE PUBLIC THEY SERVE. If they fail to serve well, they pay by the loss of their privilege of serving
    
-   The wages of sin is death!
    
-   Every person must be his own salesman of personal services
    
-   QUALITY, plus QUANTITY, plus the proper SPIRIT of cooperation, equals perfect salesmanship of service
    
-   QUALITY of service shall be construed to mean the performance of every detail, in connection with your position, in the most efficient manner possible, with the object of greater efficiency always in mind
    
-   QUANTITY of service shall be understood to mean the HABIT of rendering all the service of which you are capable, at all times, with the purpose of increasing the amount of service ren-dered as greater skill is developed through practice and experience. Emphasis is again placed on the word HABIT.
    
-   SPIRIT of service shall be construed to mean the HABIT of agreeable, harmonious conduct which will induce cooperation from associates and fellow employees
    
-   The conduct, or the SPIRIT in which you deliver service, is a strong determining factor in connection with both the price you receive, and the duration of employment
    
-   If one has a personality which PLEASES, and renders service in a spirit of HARMONY, these assets often make up for deficiencies in both the QUALITY, and the QUANTITY of service one renders. Nothing, however, can be SUCCESSFULLY SUBSTITUTED FOR PLEASING CONDUCT
    
-   There is something radically wrong with a civilization, and a system of education, which permit 98% of the people to go through life as failures
    
-   Any person who is educated is one who has learned to get whatever he wants in life without violating the rights of others. Education consists, not so much of knowledge, but of knowledge effectively and persistently APPLIED. Men are paid, not merely for what they know, but more particularly for WHAT THEY DO WITH THAT WHICH THEY KNOW
    
-   Discipline comes through self-control. This means that one must control all negative qualities. Before you can control conditions, you must first control yourself. Self-mastery is the hardest job you will ever tackle. If you do not conquer self, you will be conquered by self
    
-   Eat healthy, think positive, exercise, breath deeply
    
-   As the twig is bent, so shall the tree grow
    
-   Do not wait. The time will never be 'just right.' Start where you stand, and work with whatever tools you may have at your command, and better tools will be found as you go along
    
-   Most of us are good 'starters' but poor 'finishers' of everything we begin. Moreover, people are prone to give up at the first signs of defeat. There is no substitute for PERSISTENCE. Failure cannot cope with PERSISTENCE
    
-   There is no hope of success for the person who repels people through a negative personality. Success comes through the application of POWER, and power is attained through the cooperative efforts of other people. A negative personality will not induce cooperation
    
-   Men who succeed reach decisions promptly, and change them, if at all, very slowly
    
-   Men who succeed keep open minds and are afraid of nothing
    
-   The most essential step in the marketing of personal services is that of selecting an occupation into which you can throw yourself wholeheartedly
    
-   Enthusiasm is contagious, and the person who has it, under control, is generally welcome in any group of people
    
-   There is no substitute for honesty
    
-   Before you even start to negotiate for a readjustment of your salary in your present position, or to seek employment elsewhere, BE SURE THAT YOU ARE WORTH MORE THAN YOU NOW RECEIVE
    
-   Pg. 115 lots of great questions to ask yourself
    
-   All who seek riches must recognize and adapt themselves to the system that controls all approaches to fortunes, large or small
    
-   There is but one dependable method of accumulating, and legally holding riches, and that is by rendering useful service
    
-   America provides all the freedom and all the opportunity to accumulate riches that any honest person may require
    
-   Step up to the front, select what you want, create your plan, put the plan into action, and follow through with PERSISTENCE
    
-   You have a brain and mind of your own. USE IT, and reach your own decisions
    
-   Keep your eyes and ears wide open-and your mouth CLOSED, if you wish to acquire the habit of prompt DECISION
    
-   Those who talk too much do little else. If you talk more than you listen, you not only deprive yourself of many opportunities to accumulate useful knowledge, but you also disclose your PLANS and PURPOSES to people who will take great delight in defeating you, because they envy you
    
-   Every time you open your mouth in the presence of a person who has an abundance of knowledge, you display to that person, your exact stock of knowledge, or your LACK of it! Genuine wisdom is usually conspicuous through modesty and silence
    
-   TELL THE WORLD WHAT YOU INTEND TO DO, BUT FIRST SHOW IT
    
-   Deeds, and not words, are what count most
    
-   The value of decisions depends upon the courage required to render them. The great decisions, which served as the foundation of civilization, were reached by assuming great risks, which often meant the possibility of death
    
-   Thought, backed by strong DESIRE, has a tendency to transmute itself into its physical equivalent
    
-   The POWER which gave this nation its freedom, is the self-same power that must be used by every individual who becomes self-determining
    
-   Those who reach DECISIONS promptly and definitely, know what they want, and generally get it. The leaders in every walk of life DECIDE quickly, and firmly. That is the major reason why they are leaders. The world has the habit of making room for the man whose words and actions show that he knows where he is going
    
-   PERSISTENCE: THE SUSTAINED EFFORT NECESSARY TO INDUCE FAITH
    
-   PERSISTENCE is an essential factor in the procedure of transmuting DESIRE into its monetary equivalent. The basis of persistence is the POWER OF WILL
    
-   Men who accumulate great fortunes are generally known as cold-blooded, and sometimes ruthless. Often they are misunderstood. What they have is will-power, which they mix with persistence, and place back of their desires to insure the attainment of their objectives
    
-   The starting point of all achievement is DESIRE
    
-   Weak desires bring weak results
    
-   Fortunes gravitate to men whose minds have been prepared to 'attract' them
    
-   Without PERSISTENCE, you will be defeated, even before you start. With PERSISTENCE you will win
    
-   Be PERSISTENT no matter how slowly you may, at first, have to move
    
-   WITH PERSISTENCE WILL COME SUCCESS
    
-   THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR PERSISTENCE
    
-   EVERY FAILURE BRINGS WITH IT THE SEED OF AN EQUIVALENT ADVANTAGE
    
-   Persistence is a state of mind, therefore it can be cultivated
    
-   DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE. Knowing what one wants is the first and, perhaps, the most important step toward the development of persistence. A strong motive forces one to surmount many difficulties
    
-   DESIRE. It is comparatively easy to acquire and to maintain persistence in pursuing the object of intense desire
    
-   SELF-RELIANCE. Belief in one's ability to carry out a plan encourages one to follow the plan through with persistence
    
-   DEFINITENESS OF PLANS. Organized plans, even though they may be weak and entirely impractical, encourage persistence
    
-   ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE. Knowing that one's plans are sound, based upon experience or observation, encourages persistence; 'guessing' instead of 'knowing' destroys persistence
    
-   CO-OPERATION. Sympathy, understanding, and harmonious cooperation with others tend to develop persistence
    
-   WILL-POWER. The habit of concentrating one's thoughts upon the building of plans for the attainment of a definite purpose, leads to persistence
    
-   HABIT. Persistence is the direct result of habit. The mind absorbs and becomes a part of the daily experiences upon which it feeds. Fear, the worst of all enemies, can be effectively cured by forced repetition of cwt8 of courage. Everyone who has seen active service in war knows this
    
-   To thine own self be true, and it must follow, as the night the day, thou canst not then be false to any man
    
-   POWER may be defined as 'organized and intelligently directed KNOWLEDGE
    
-   POWER is essential for success in the accumulation of money. PLANS are inert and useless, without sufficient POWER to translate them into ACTION
    
-   Power, as the term is here used, refers to ORGANIZED effort, sufficient to enable an individual to transmute DESIRE into its monetary equivalent
    
-   ENERGY is Nature's universal set of building blocks, out of which she constructs every material thing in the universe, including man, and every form of animal and vegetable life
    
-   Men take on the nature and the habits and the POWER OF THOUGHT of those with whom they associate in a spirit of sympathy and harmony
    
-   Sex desire is the most powerful of human desires. When driven by this desire, men develop keenness of imagination, courage, will-power, persistence, and creative ability unknown to them at other times
    
-   It should be given an outlet through forms of expression which enrich the body, mind, and spirit of man
    
-   Fortunate, indeed, is the person who has discovered how to give sex emotion an outlet through some form of creative effort, for he has, by that discovery, lifted himself to the status of a genius
    
-   The men who have accumulated great fortunes and achieved outstanding recognition in literature, art, industry, architecture, and the professions, were motivated by the influence of a woman
    
-   Genius is, 'a man who has discovered how to increase the vibrations of thought to the point where he can freely communicate with sources of knowledge not available through the ordinary rate of vibration of thought
    
-   I speak through ideas which come to me from within
    
-   The stimuli to which the mind responds most freely are:1. The desire for sex expression 2. Love 3. A burning desire for fame, power, or financial gain, MONEY 4. Music 5. Friendship between either those of the same sex, or those of the opposite sex. 6. A Master Mind alliance based upon the harmony of two or more people who ally themselves for spiritual or temporal advancement. 7. Mutual suffering, such as that experienced by people who are persecuted. 8. Auto-suggestion 9. Fear 10. Narcotics and alcohol.
    
-   1. HESTIMULATESHISMINDSOTHATITVIBRATESONAHIGHER-THANAVERAGE PLANE, using one or more of the ten mind stimulants or some other stimulant of his choice. 2. HE CONCENTRATES upon the known factors (the finished part) of his invention, and creates in his mind a perfect picture of unknown factors (the unfinished part), of his invention. He holds this picture in mind until it has been taken over by the subconscious mind, then relaxes by clearing his mind of ALL thought, and waits for his answer to 'flash' into his mind
    
-   Sex influence, from the right source, is more powerful than any substitute of expediency, which may be created by mere reason
    
-   The human mind responds to stimulation! Among the greatest, and most powerful of these stimuli is the urge of sex. When harnessed and transmuted, this driving force is capable of lifting men into that higher sphere of thought which enables them to master the sources of worry and petty annoyance which beset their pathway on the lower plane
    
-   Sex energy is the creative energy of all genii. There never has been, and never will be a great leader, builder, or artist lacking in this driving force of sex
    
-   The world is ruled, and the destiny of civilization is established, by the human emotions. People are influenced in their actions, not by reason so much as by 'feelings.' The creative faculty of the mind is set into action entirely by emotions, and not by cold reason. The most powerful of all human emotions is that of sex. There are other mind stimulants, some of which have been listed, but no one of them, nor all of them combined, can equal the driving power of sex
    
-   People who lack sex energy will never become enthusiastic nor inspire others with enthusiasm
    
-   People who lack sex energy will never become enthusiastic nor inspire others with enthusiasm, and enthusiasm is one of the most important requisites in salesmanship, no matter what one is selling
    
-   The average man reaches the period of his greatest capacity to create between forty and sixty
    
-   The emotions of sex and jealousy, when mixed, may turn a person into an insane beast
    
-   Encourage the presence of these emotions as the dominating thoughts in one's mind, and discourage the presence of all the destructive emotions. The mind is a creature of habit. It thrives upon the dominating thoughts fed it. Through the faculty of will-power, one may discourage the presence of any emotion, and encourage the presence of any other. Control of the mind, through the power of will, is not difficult. Control comes from persistence, and habit. The secret of control lies in understanding the process of transmutation. When any negative emotion presents itself in one's mind, it can be transmuted into a positive, or constructive emotion, by the simple procedure of changing one's thoughts
    
-   THERE IS NO OTHER ROAD TO GENIUS THAN THROUGH VOLUNTARY SELF EFFORT!
    
-   You may VOLUNTARILY plant in your subconscious mind any plan, thought, or purpose which you desire to translate into its physical or monetary equivalent. The subconscious acts first on the dominating desires which have been mixed with emotional feeling, such as faith
    
-   Through a method of procedure, unknown to man, the subconscious mind draws upon the forces of Infinite Intelligence for the power with which it voluntarily transmutes one's desires into their physical equivalent, making use, always of the most practical media by which this end may be accomplished
    
-   You cannot entirely control your subconscious mind, but you can voluntarily hand over to it any plan, desire, or purpose which you wish transformed into concrete form
    
-   The subconscious mind may be voluntarily directed only through habit
    
-   Everything which man creates, BEGINS in the form of a thought impulse. Man can create nothing which he does not first conceive in THOUGHT. Through the aid of the imagination, thought impulses may be assembled into plans. The imagination, when under control, may be used for the creation of plans or purposes that lead to success in one's chosen occupation
    
-   ONLY emotionalized thoughts have any ACTION influence upon the subconscious mind
    
-   Have desire, faith, love, sex, enthusiasm, romance, hope
    
-   Avoid fear, jealousy, hatred, revenge, greed, superstition, anger
    
-   Through the aid of the sixth sense, you will be warned of impending dangers in time to avoid them, and notified of opportunities in time to embrace them
    
-   The SIXTH SENSE is that portion of the subconscious mind which has been referred to as the Creative Imagination. It has also been referred to as the 'receiving set' through which ideas, plans, and thoughts flash into the mind
    
-   Nature never deviates from her established laws
    
-   The next best thing to being truly great, is to emulate the great, by feeling and action, as nearly as possible
    
-   All men have become what they are, because of their DOMINATING THOUGHTS AND DESIRES
    
-   Every deeply seated desire has the effect of causing one to seek outward expression through which that desire may be transmuted into reality
    
-   One of the blessings of maturity is that it sometimes brings one greater courage to be truthful, regardless of what those who do not understand, may think or say
    
-   INDECISION is the seedling of FEAR
    
-   Indecision crystalizes into DOUBT, the two blend and become FEAR
    
-   Fears: poverty, criticism, ill health, loss of love of someone, old age, death
    
-   Fears are nothing more than states of mind. One's state of mind is subject to control and direction
    
-   Immunity against the disease consisted, largely, if not solely, in their absolute lack of FEAR
    
-   Man can create nothing which he does not first conceive in the form of an impulse of thought.
    
-   MAN'S THOUGHT IMPULSES BEGIN IMMEDIATELY TO TRANSLATE THEMSELVES INTO THEIR PHYSICAL EQUIVALENT, WHETHER THOSE THOUGHTS ARE VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY
    
-   Every human being has the ability to completely control his own mind, and with this control, obviously, every person may open his mind to the tramp thought impulses which are being released by other brains, or close the doors tightly and admit only thought impulses of his own choice
    
-   Nature has endowed man with absolute control over but one thing, and that is THOUGHT
    
-   ALL THOUGHT HAS A TENDENCY TO CLOTHE ITSELF IN ITS PHYSICAL EQUIVALENT
    
-   If you want riches, you must refuse to accept any circumstance that leads toward poverty
    
-   If you demand riches, determine what form, and how much will be required to satisfy you. You know the road that leads to riches. You have been given a road map which, if followed, will keep you on that road. If you neglect to make the start, or stop before you arrive, no one will be to blame, but YOU. This responsibility is yours. No alibi will save you from accepting the responsibility if you now fail or refuse to demand riches of Life, because the acceptance calls for but one thing-incidentally, the only thing you can control-and that is a STATE OF MIND. A state of mind is something that one assumes. It cannot be purchased, it must be created
    
-   Those who succeed in any calling must prepare their minds to resist the evil
    
-   If you fail to control your own mind, you may be sure you will control nothing else
    
-   Mind control is the result of self-discipline and habit. You either control your mind or it controls you
    
-   The most practical of all methods for controlling the mind is the habit of keeping it busy with a definite purpose, backed by a definite plan

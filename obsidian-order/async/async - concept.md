Asynchronous programming is a programming paradigm that allows multiple tasks to be executed concurrently without blocking the flow of program execution. In this model, tasks can start, run, and complete in overlapping time periods, enabling the program to continue processing other tasks while waiting for a long-running task to complete.

Asynchronous programming is particularly useful in situations where a task may take a long time to complete, such as waiting for a server response, reading a large file, or performing a complex computation. By allowing the program to continue executing other tasks while waiting for these time-consuming operations, asynchronous programming can lead to more efficient and responsive applications.

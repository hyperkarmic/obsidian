# async/await
Async:Async/Await is a new feature of JavaScript that make handling asynchronous easy, we can mark a function to be asynchronous using the `async` keyword and then we use the `await` keyword to await some asynchronous task and continue writing other logic inside our function. async/await is a much-improved way of dealing with promises,

Async:Await:Funny enough, Async/Await: is made out of promises combined with another scary concept in JavaScript, generators.

Async/Await:The `async`/`await` pattern allows non-blocking code to be written as though it’s blocking code.

  Async = An async function is a function declared with the `async` keyword, and the `await` keyword is permitted within them. The `async` and `await` keywords enable asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style, avoiding the need to explicitly configure promise chains.
<hr>
  Async = The word “async” before a function means one simple thing: a function always returns a promise. Other values are wrapped in a resolved promise automatically.( `async` ensures that the function returns a promise, and wraps non-promises in it.)

  Async/Await: The word “async” before a function means one simple thing: a function always returns a promise. The keyword “await” makes JavaScript wait until that promise settles and returns its result.

  Await: The keyword `await` makes JavaScript wait until that promise settles and returns its result.

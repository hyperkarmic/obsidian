# then

In promise, any of the above state is handled by `.then()` which is a Promise method. `.then()` method takes two arguments- first argument is a callback function to handle the fulfilled state while the second argument is function callback for the rejected state. In Promises, the success and failed state are handled by `resolve()` and `reject()` functions respectively. While making an asynchronous call, `resolve()` function is used to handle the success of the asynchronous operation while `reject()` is used to handle the failure of the operation.

# Promises
### -   Promises: wrap an asynchronous action in an object, which can be passed around and told to do certain things when the action finishes or fails
<hr>
### The **Promise** object represents the **eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation** and its resulting value.

Promises represent a cleaner way of performing asynchronous tasks, a promise basically will return the result of an asynchronous process and you can access that using a then method to handle the data, or a catch method to handle errors
***
Promise:A promise is an object that represents the result of an asynchronous operation. Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in a more synchronous way. When an asynchronous operation is started, a promise is created. The promise is then waiting for the asynchronous operation to finish. Once the asynchronous operation finishes, the promise is either resolved ( fulfilled) or rejected.

Promise:In JavaScript (ES6 and above), a `Promise` is an object representing the state and result of asynchronous operations such as an API call, or IO read/write. The states include _pending_, _fulfilled_, and _rejected_.

Promises: A JavaScript Promise object contains both the producing code and calls to the consuming code:

  Consumers: then, catch, finally

  Promise: A `[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)` is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. Essentially, a promise is a returned object to which you attach callbacks, instead of passing callbacks into a function.

Promise: A promise in JavaScript is an assurance that an asynchronous operation will be completed eventually (either a success or a failure).

A promise is an object that can produce a certain value at some point in the future or a reason why it couldn’t produce the value. Promises are used in cases where we can’t predict when the result if any will be returned.

# ORM

**ORM:** Object-relational-mapping is the idea of being able to write queries like the one above, as well as much more complicated ones, using the object-oriented paradigm of your preferred programming language.

**ORM:** According to Wikipedia an ORM is defined as a “technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages”. Well, that does not give much detail into what they are capable of. So let us break it down into simpler terms.

-   An ORM allows us to interact with databases in the language that we prefer to code with.
    
-   It can also give you advanced features to help you manage and manipulate the information within your database.
    
-   The queries you create with an ORM can also perform better than a manual query written in the native language of the database.
    

But with all great things, there are always drawbacks that you must consider, such as:

-   The initial configuration of an ORM can be difficult.
    
-   There is additional learning that must be done to use any specific ORM.
    
-   It is also important to know exactly what your code is doing, and an ORM can make the commands it is executing more abstract therefore it can make a developer weaker in that part of the stack.
    

  
  

**ORM:**ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a technique that helps you to query and manipulate data from databases using an object-oriented paradigm. Nowadays developers like to use ORMs due to several reasons like,

-   Since we have to write a data model only in one place it is easier to update, maintain, and reuse the code.
    
-   Forces you to write [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) code, which makes your code cleaner.
    
-   No need for writing SQL queries.
    
-   No need for database-level changes frequently.
    
-   Most of the work is automated.
    

But there are a few disadvantages of ORMs as well.

-   Performance issue with complex queries.
    
-   Integration and learning.

In programming, pattern matching is a feature that allows a programmer to match the structure of an object to a pattern, and then execute code based on the properties of that pattern. This is often used to perform different actions based on the type of an object, or to extract specific information from an object. It is commonly found in functional programming languages such as Haskell, Erlang, and Scala.
***
**JavaScript doesnâ€™t have a built-in pattern matching feature**, it can only be implemented using a combination of other language features such as destructuring, if-else statements, and switch statements.

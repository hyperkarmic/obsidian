# monad
Concludingly, we can say that Monads are just a beautiful and generic way of handling side effects in pure functions and provide a scalable approach for composing pure functions by using bind and unit concepts.
***
In functional programming, a monad is a design pattern that allows for the composition of functions that use and return a specific type of value,  
called the “wrapped” value. Monads provide a way to abstract away the  
handling of certain types of computations, such as dealing with null or  
undefined values, exceptions, or asynchrony.

A common example of a monad in JavaScript is the “Maybe” monad, which can be used to handle the possibility of null or undefined values.

# functional programming - definition
Functional Programming: In contrast, functional programming is a form of declarative programming. You tell the computer what you want done by calling a method or function.

Functional Programming: Another principle of functional programming is to always declare your dependencies explicitly. This means if a function depends on a variable or object being present, then pass that variable or object directly into the function as an argument.

 Functional programming: The imperative style revolves around writing the instructions (statements).

Functional programming, on the other hand, is about describing our data.

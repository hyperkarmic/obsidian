## Composition

-   Composition involves combining several small (often pure) functions together
-   This can be done by chaining methods together using the dot notation or passing the output from one function to the next

## Composition

Inheritance is a powerful mechanism to extend entities but not every problem can fit into its mental model. Forcing the design of a solution with inheritance can lead to more complex and hard to maintain implementations.

Composition is an alternative approach that lets us put larger, more complex objects together by combining multiple small ones.

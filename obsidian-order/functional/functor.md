Functors are a concept from functional programming that are used to represent a container or wrapper around a value. A functor is an object that has a special method called `map` that allows you to apply a function to the value inside the container, and then return a new container with the transformed value.

Functors are a way to abstract away the idea of a container, and to define a common interface for different types of containers. This makes it easy to write code that works with many different types of containers, without having to know the specific details of how each container works.

Functors are similar to monads in that they provide a way to abstract away a certain type of computation, but they differ in that monads are typically used to handle specific types of computations, such as null or undefined values, or async operations, whereas functors are more general and can be used to handle any type of computation on a container.

In JavaScript, arrays and objects can be considered as functors, as they can be mapped over and return a new array or object with the transformed values. Also, many libraries such as Ramda, Lodash, and Immutable.js provide functor-like functionality for JavaScript objects.

Functors can be useful in functional programming to create a more expressive and abstract code, allowing the developer to separate the logic of the computation from the container holding the data.

# Commit


> A commit is a snapshot of your project saved in git. A commit takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot.

_Commit:_ _In git, is the action of adding your changes to the local repository. It is usually accompanied by a commit message that describes the changes. Though this last is usually misused,_ _[having a proper commit message is very important](https://livecodestream.dev/post/telling-the-story-of-your-project-one-commit-at-a-time/)_ _._

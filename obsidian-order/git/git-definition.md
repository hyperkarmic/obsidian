# GIT definition
### `Git` works by storing a snapshot of the entire repository at any given point of time when you **commit** changes (a **commit** can be considered to be an equivalent of a _save_). So whenever you wish, you can go back to any previous commits and make modifications.
<hr>To **commit** changes, you need to specify the files whose changes you want to **commit** first. This is done by staging the changes. It is NOT required that you stage all files you modified, you can stage only the files whose changes you want to **commit**
<hr>
`add stages commit commits!!!!!!`
<hr>
After several **commits** if you require to check out the commits you have made, check out the logs using: git log

## The Phases of Git

Git has 3 phases where files can reside in: **Modified, Staged and Committed.**

-   **Modified** means that the files have been edited but not yet committed to the database
- ###### ie coding and coding changes
-   **Staged** means that the file has been marked in its current edition to go into the next snapshot
- ###### ie git add!!!!!
-   **Committed** means that the files have been stored in the local database.
- ###### ie git committed!!!!

Therefore, there are three important parts to a Git project: The **Working** **Tree**, the **Staging** **Area** and the **Git** **Directory.**

The basic Git Workflow looks like this:

1.  Modify files in the Working Tree/Directory
2.  Stage the changes to be committed, adding those files to the staging area.
3.  Committing the files in the staging area, which then stores it in the Git directory permanently.

If a file has been saved to the directory, it is considered **committed.** If a file has been edited, chose for being committed but not yet committed, it has been **staged**. If a file has not been staged, but has been edited, it has been **modified**.

# Git Ignore
This is is a file to stop git hoovering up large files that can be made locally - here is a magic command line trick to produce them!!!

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">touch .gitignore && echo "node_modules/" >> .gitignore && git rm -r --cached node_modules ; git status</mark> 

to be fair --- one only has to use the code behind the ampersands!!!!

#git 
#gitignore

## GIT STASH

**8 — git stash**

It temporarily saves uncommitted changes (both staged and unstaged) for later use. Be aware that stash is local to your git repository.

**9 — git stash pop**

It removes the changes from the stash and reapplies them to your working copy of current branch.

**10 — git stash apply**

It reapplies the changes from the stash to your working copy of current branch and keep the new changes in the stash.

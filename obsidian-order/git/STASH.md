## GIT STASH

### Git stash is a built-in command with the distributed version control tool in Git that locally stores all the most recent changes in a workspace and resets the state of the workspace to the prior commit state.

The **stash** can be thought of as a _temporary storage_ for the _changes you made, but did not **commit**_.

**8 — git stash**

It temporarily saves uncommitted changes (both staged and unstaged) for later use. Be aware that stash is local to your git repository.

**9 — git stash pop**

It removes the changes from the stash and reapplies them to your working copy of current branch.

**10 — git stash apply**

It reapplies the changes from the stash to your working copy of current branch and keep the new changes in the stash.

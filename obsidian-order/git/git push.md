## git push

 Push:In git, `push` is the action of sending all your commits to a remote repository, so it is backed up and available to other developers in the team or that have access to the repository.

***

I use the **git push command*** to send locally committed changes to the GitHub remote branch. This ensures that the branch on the remote repository contains all the updates made on the local branch.

#git #git-push

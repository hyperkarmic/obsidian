##cherry pick


`_git cherry-pick_` _is like copying something from a folder and pasting it in another folder. So, it will not delete the commit from where you cherry picked and in destination branch commit id will also be different._
<hr>
### Need a feature introduced in a **commit** in another branch, but the branch is not ready to be **merged** yet? No, you don't have to take the _500-year long nap_ till the branch is merged!

You can just **Cherry Pick** the commits you require
<hr>

git cherry-pick <commit-id>


git cherry-pick -x <commit hash>


git cherry-pick  <commit hash>

### Fast Forward Merge

The **Fast Forward Merge** takes place when the _destination branch of the merge does not contain any new commits_. In such a case, only the **pointer** of the branch is _moved forward to the required commit_. **It does not add any new commits!**
<hr>
### Recursive Merge

The **Recursive Merge** takes place where both the _source & destination branches of the merge contain new commits_. In such a case, a _new commit is introduced in the destination branch_, merging all changes.

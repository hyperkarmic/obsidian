## Advantages of Git

-   **Tracks your code changes** — If something breaks between your current code and a previous version, you can quickly locate the bug by looking at the history of your code changes.
-   **Easy Revert and Rollback** — If you make bulk changes to your software and many things break in the process, you can discard all your changes. If you need to back several versions, you can roll back your entire git repository to the previous version.
-   **Remote Repositories** — Remote repositories will host your code for you. If you are working on a new machine, you can easily clone the repository and start working on your code again.
-   **GitHub** — GitHub is a remote repository that allows you to showcase your work to the entire world. If you don’t like that, you can use a private repository. You will also have access to CI/CD features, Wikis, and much more.

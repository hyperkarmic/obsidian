# REACT CONTEXT
# What is Context?

A Context is basically a JavaScript object that can be passed from one parent component to several child components efficiently. Props can pass values to components as well. But, if a value needs to be passed to a child component deep in the component tree, using props means the value also passes through components that do not need it. Or, if a value is required by several components, props can make it difficult.

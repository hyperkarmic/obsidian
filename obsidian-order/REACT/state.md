# state
State: State is just the data-set a component is using at a particular time
***
A state is the current data passed in React components. State management in React enables you to dynamically update data in Components.
***
-   UI State —the state of the application a.k.a. toggles, modals, settings
-   Form State — the different states of a form (disabled, validating, validated, onBlur validation, onSubmit validation, loading, submitting etc…)
-   Server Cache State — the state from the server, which is cached client-side
-   URL State — the state managed by your browser (filtering, querying etc)

[State](https://pandaquests.medium.com/state-in-reactjs-a8392a7bbcb3): State is an object that stores data that can be used to update the UI. It should be used carefully, as changes to the state can trigger the re-rendering of the component.
***
State in ReactJS is a way for a component to store and manage information internally. It’s like a component’s “memory” that allows it to remember and keep track of certain values or data.
***
-   The main advantage of using state in ReactJS is that it allows a component to store and manage information internally, rather than relying on props (props are data that is passed to a component from its parent). This makes it easier to build reusable and self-contained components, as they can manage their own data and behavior without relying on the data and behavior of their parent components.
-   Another advantage of state is that it allows a component to respond to user actions and events, such as clicks, form submissions, and hover events. This makes it possible to build interactive and dynamic user interfaces that can change and update based on user input.
-   Additionally, state can improve the performance of a React application by allowing components to re-render only when necessary, rather than re-rendering every time the parent component updates. This can help reduce the number of unnecessary re-renders and improve the overall performance of the application.
-   Finally, state can make it easier to debug and troubleshoot a React application, as it allows you to track the data and behavior of individual components, rather than trying to debug the entire application at once.
***
Here are a few examples of how state might be used in a React application:

-   Storing form input: State can be used to store the values of form fields and input elements, allowing a component to keep track of user input and respond to changes.
-   Managing application state: State can be used to store and manage global application state, such as the currently logged-in user, the current page, or the selected theme.
-   Displaying data: State can be used to store and display data that is fetched from an external API or database, allowing a component to show dynamic and up-to-date information to the user.
-   Handling user interactions: State can be used to track and respond to user interactions, such as clicks, hover events, and form submissions.
-   Improving performance: State can be used to control when a component re-renders, allowing you to avoid unnecessary re-renders and improve the performance of your application.
-   Debugging and troubleshooting: State can make it easier to debug and troubleshoot a React application by allowing you to track the data and behavior of individual components.

# NextJs
Next:**Next.js** is a React __framework__ that provides additional optimizations and configurations out-of-the-box for developers.

Next:Next.js eliminates the need for a backend framework by taking it one step further. It allows you to create React applications that are completely server-rendered. This means that the user’s browser will download a complete HTML page, including all the necessary assets like JavaScript files, CSS files, and images. It also ships with built-in support for React components, so you can create sophisticated user interfaces without having to worry about routing, state management, and other common frontend concerns.

# JSX
JSX stands for JavaScript XML and is React’s unique syntax extension based on JavaScript and is generally considered as faster, safer and easier than JavaScript. This is due to a variety of reasons including that we can write HTML and JavaScript in it, its ability to convert HTML tags into React elements, and it’s reliance on ES6 which is then converted into regular JavaScript at runtime.

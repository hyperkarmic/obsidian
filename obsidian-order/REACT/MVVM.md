# MVVM
MVVM (the secret to REACT):The generic MVVM pattern knowledge helps you to get started with any frontend framework so fast, write clean UI-manipulation code, and write well-testable code. Some developers may argue by saying that React is neither MVVM nor MVC, and itâ€™s just a library to manipulate View. However, the way it lets developers write code is undoubtedly MVVM.

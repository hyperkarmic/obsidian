# React Router

## Why react-router?

React itself does not contain a library for page routing. Thus, the standard library for routing in React, ‘react-router-dom’ can be installed as an external library which is the favored mechanism to adopt routing in react applications. It maps user interfaces to browser URLs, keep tab of history stack (so one can navigate back and forth) and allows to render nested UI by matching routes.

react-router lets you define your routes and your navigation logic in a single place, and then renders the right component for each route. react-router also provides a number of powerful features like nested routes, route parameters, and a built-in history object.

react-router is perfect for creating single-page applications with React. By defining your routes and navigation logic in a single place, you can keep your code well-organized and easy to read. And by using react-router’s built-in history object, you can keep your application’s URL bar in sync with your React components.

react-router also provides a number of powerful features for creating sophisticated navigation solutions. For example, you can use nested routes to create hierarchical navigation menus, and you can use route parameters to pass data between your route

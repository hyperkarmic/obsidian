# React Router

## Why react-router?

React itself does not contain a library for page routing. Thus, the standard library for routing in React, ‘react-router-dom’ can be installed as an external library which is the favored mechanism to adopt routing in react applications. It maps user interfaces to browser URLs, keep tab of history stack (so one can navigate back and forth) and allows to render nested UI by matching routes.

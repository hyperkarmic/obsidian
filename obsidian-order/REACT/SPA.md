# SPA

_A Single Page Application (SPA) is a single web page, website, or web application that works within a web browser and loads just a single document. It does not need page reloading during its usage, and most of its content remains the same while only some of it needs updating. When the content needs to be updated, the SPA does it through JavaScript APIs._

SPA:his way, users can view a website without loading the entire new page and data from the server. As a result, performance increases, and you feel like using a native application. It offers a more dynamic web experience to the users. SPAs help users be in a single, uncomplicated web space in easy, workable, and simple ways.

Single-page app (SPA) is quite similar to the concept of virtual DOM. It will only **dynamically rewriting** the nodes that have been affected from the server, while traditional multi-page web apps will always re-render a whole HTML file with every click you make and sends it to your browser.

**SPA Pros  
**Since most websites have a lot of repeating content, the major benefit of SPAs is their **high speed** and **responsiveness**, especially when the user has a bad network connection or heavy traffic. It can even **work offline** after being loaded for the first time with the help of caching (without API calls for new data of course). Therefore, it provides a **better user experience**.

Another benefit of SPAs is their **compatibility with mobile development**. Developers can use relatively the same code to develop a native mobile application.

**SPA Cons  
**Although SPAs are fast, they can **affect SEO optimisation**. Since SEO bots usually only index the main page of SPAs, the reloaded content won’t be taken into consideration. Therefore, their rankings on search engines may drop. Nevertheless, Google is continuously updating its search algorithms to fix this issue. There are also approaches to optimise it with isomorphic React apps[9].

SPAs also come with more **security vulnerabilities**. Since the default settings for SPA is client-side rendering, it is more prone to attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks through injecting malicious Javascript code to the client side.

**When to Use SPAs  
**SPAs are particularly suitable for pages with **rich UI and interactions** as it reloads only a small JSON file rather than a whole page. Therefore, social media websites (eg. Facebook) or pages with fancy animations are often SPAs.

On the other hand, large companies (eg. online stores such as Amazon, eBay) with a broad range of services and products would benefit more from MPAs, as they usually need SEO optimisations and connection to multiple user databases [10].

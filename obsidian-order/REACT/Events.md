[Events](https://pandaquests.medium.com/events-in-reactjs-c664d99a5492): Events are actions that can be triggered by the user, such as clicking a button or typing in a text field. React provides a way to bind event handlers to components, which allows you to execute code in response to events.

In ReactJS, an event is something that happens within the app that triggers a specific action. Itâ€™s similar to a real-life event, like someone pressing a button on a doorbell, which triggers the door to open.

Here are a few examples of events in React:

-   Clicking a button: When a user clicks a button, an event is triggered and a specific action can occur, such as submitting a form or navigating to a new page.
-   Hovering over an element: When a user hovers their mouse over a specific element, an event is triggered and a specific action can occur, such as displaying a tooltip or changing the color of the element.
-   Typing in an input field: When a user types into an input field, an event is triggered and a specific action can occur, such as validating the input or displaying suggestions.

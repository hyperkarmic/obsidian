# prop drilling vS Context vS Redux
-   If we are going to transfer data between several components, we might be prefer **Prob drilling**.
-   If we have data that isn’t frequently refreshed or changed and we are working on a medium sized application then we might be prefer **Context API**.
-   If we have data that frequently refreshed or changed(if you are working with live data) and we are working on a large sized application then we might be prefer **Redux**.

# diffing algorithm
**Diffing-Algorithm:**Â A diff algorithm outputs the set of differences between two inputs. These algorithms are the basis of a number of commonly used developer tools. Git is one example where a developer can read, commit, pull, and merge diffs without ever understanding the underlying diff algorithm.

While diffing two trees, React first looks at the two root components. The conduct is distinctive relying upon the sorts of the root components.

React utilizes a method called the diffing calculation to contrast the old DOM with the new. Diffing is a heuristic calculation dependent on two suspicions:

-   Two components of various sorts will create various trees.
-   The designer can indicate what components will stay stable across renders with a key prop.

# 4 easy tips on how to become a faster React developer.

We have finished with the main part, let’s relax a bit. I will give you 4 easy tips.

# 1. Never format your code by hand

Your IDE should provide you with an “auto reformat code” feature. Your React project should contain .eslintrc.js and .prettierrc.js files. They configure linting (red lines) and code style. You should be able to apply these stiles by pressing a hotkey:

To be fast you need:

-   Separate business logic from the view logic
-   Use TypeScript to experiences fewer bugs
-   Use TypeScript to enable powerful IDE features: linting, name refactoring, autocompletion
-   Define TypeScript types before writing code for the rapid architecture design
-   Split your code into many small reusable files to reduce clutter
-   Ask your IDE to format code and import modules
-   Jump around files with hotkeys
-   Practice refactoring

# 2. Never import modules by hand

Your IDE should provide you with an “auto import” feature. Never type “../../../” by hand, or waste your time by manually typing/deleting imports.


# 3. Jump around like a pro

If you build your project from small reusable parts, you will have lots of small reusable files and components. It will soon become clear for you, that navigation with “mouse and opened tabs” and “picking a file in a files list” becomes almost impossible.

Your IDE should provide you with these helpful tools:

-   jump to file by a search string
-   jump to a component by a search string
-   jump to the previously opened file
-   jump to a definition of a component under your cursor
-   jump to component usage

Study your IDE’s hotkeys. This will make your developer’s experience smooth as butter.

# 4. Use ESLint linting

Every React developer knows the pain of a wrong useEffect/Memo/Callback hook dependency. They are always hard to find errors:

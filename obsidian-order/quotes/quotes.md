> I like my code to be elegant and efficient. The logic should be straightforward to make it hard for bugs to hide, the dependencies minimal to ease maintenance, error handling complete according to an articulated strategy, and performance close to optimal so as not to tempt people to make the code messy with unprincipled optimizations. Clean code does one thing well.

— _Bjarne Stroustrup_
***
> Clean code can be read, and enhanced by a developer other than its original author. It has unit and acceptance tests. It has meaningful names. It provides one way rather than many ways for doing one thing. It has minimal dependencies, which are explicitly defined, and provides a clear and minimal API. Code should be literate since depending on the language, not all necessary information can be expressed clearly in code alone.

“One of the paradoxes of defensive programming is that during development, you’d like an error to be noticeable — you’d rather have it be obnoxious than risk overlooking it. But during production, you’d rather have the error be as unobtrusive as possible, to have the program recover or fail gracefully.”

Managers of programming projects aren’t always aware that certain programming issues are matters of religion. If you’re a manager and you try to require compliance with certain programming practices, you’re inviting your programmers’ ire. Here’s a list of religious issues:  
■ Programming language  
■ Indentation style  
■ Placing of braces  
■ Choice of IDE  
■ Commenting style  
■ Efficiency vs. readability tradeoffs  
■ Choice of methodology—for example, Scrum vs. Extreme Programming vs. evolutionary delivery  
■ Programming utilities  
■ Naming conventions  
■ Use of gotos  
■ Use of global variables  
■ Measurements, especially productivity measures such as lines of code per day.

Many rookie software managers think that they can "motivate" their programmers to work faster by giving them nice, "tight" (unrealistically short) schedules. I think this kind of motivation is brain-dead. When I'm behind schedule, I feel doomed and depressed and unmotivated. When I'm working ahead of schedule, I'm cheerful and productive.

We know from painful experience that letting a third party layer of software come between the platform and the developer ultimately results in sub-standard apps and hinders the enhancement and progress of the platform. If developers grow dependent on third party development libraries and tools, they can only take advantage of platform enhancements if and when the third party chooses to adopt the new features. We cannot be at the mercy of a third party deciding if and when they will make our enhancements available to our developers.

Testing by itself does not improve software quality. Test results are an indicator of quality, but in and of themselves, they don’t improve it. Trying to improve software quality by increasing the amount of testing is like trying to lose weight by weighing yourself more often. What you eat before you step onto the scale determines how much you will weigh, and the software development techniques you use determine how many errors testing will find. If you want to lose weight, don’t buy a new scale; change your diet. If you want to improve your software, don’t test more; develop better.

I can remember the exact instant when I realized that a large part of my life from then on was going to be spent in finding mistakes in my own programs.

        — Maurice Wilkes discovers debugging, 1949

Complexity has nothing to do with intelligence, simplicity does.

        — Larry Bossidy

A good way to have good ideas is by being unoriginal.

        — Bram Cohen

a program is like a poem: you cannot write a poem without writing it. Yet people talk about programming as if it were a production process and measure “programmer productivity"in terms of "number of lines of code produced”.In so doing they book that number on the wrong side of the ledger: We should always refer to"the number of lines of code spent".

        — E. W. Dijkstra

Things which any idiot could write usually have the quality of having been written by an idiot.

        — Bram Cohen
***
So much complexity in software comes from trying to make one thing do two things.

        — Ryan Singer
***
A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. The inverse proposition also appears to be true: A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work.

        — John Gall

Premature optimization, that’s like a fart. Premature abstraction is like taking a dump on another developer’s desk.

        — Chris Eric

And don’t EVER make the mistake that you can design something better than what you get from ruthless massively parallel trial-and-error with a feedback cycle. That’s giving your intelligence _much_ too much credit. - Linus Torvalds

The key to developing expertise is deliberate practice: not just doing it again and again, but challenging yourself with a task that is just beyond your current ability, trying it, analyzing your performance while and after doing it, and correcting any mistakes.

Do you know what is difficult than writing a code? It’s reading someone else’s code. We all have experienced this in our journey. **Because while writing the code, we are reading our thoughts and converting into a code. And while reading a code, our mind is looking for the connection between the lines of code and their purpose of existence.** So, it may take much time than expected to understand the written code. But how do we know what we understood is correct or not! - Bhuvan Ghandi

Refactoring is a disciplined technique for restructuring an existing body of code, altering its internal structure without changing its external behavior - Martin Fowler
***
":“_Its heart is a series of small behavior preserving transformations._" - Martin Fowler
***
_Each transformation (called a “refactoring”) does little, but a sequence of these transformations can produce a significant restructuring._- Matin Fowler
***
_Since each refactoring is small, it’s less likely to go wrong._ - Martin Fowler
***
_The system is kept fully working after each refactoring, reducing the chances that a system can get seriously broken during the restructuring_”. - Martin Fowler

“… way of working backward is to start with straight with a hypothesis. If your problem is to increase profitability, you might decide that you’ll want to look at ways to increase revenues. Because increasing revenues can lead to higher profitability. Fine. But what about decreasing costs? Shouldn’t you understand the various ways that you can achieve your goal before deciding on the way to do so?” — Arnaud Chevallier, “[Work forward in solving problems, not backward](https://powerful-problem-solving.com/work-forward-in-solving-problems-not-backward/)”

Do not fall into the error of the artisan who boasts of_ **_twenty years experience_** _in craft while in fact he has had only_ **_one year of experience–twenty times_**_. And never resent the advantage of experience your elders have. Recall that they have paid for this experience in the coin of life, and have emptied a purse that cannot be refilled.”_

"Novices are very concerned about their ability to succeed; with little experience to guide them, they really don’t know whether their actions will all turn out OK. Novices don’t particularly want to learn; they just want to accomplish an immediate goal. They do not know how to respond to mistakes and so are fairly vulnerable to confusion when things go awry." - Andy Hunt - Pragmatic Thinking
***
Once past the hurdles of the novice, one begins to see the problems from the viewpoint of the advanced beginner. Advanced beginners can start to break away from the fixed rule set a little bit. They can try tasks on their own, but they still have difficulty troubleshooting.
Andy Hunt - Pragmatic Thinking
***
At this third stage, practitioners can now develop conceptual models of the problem domain and work with those models effectively. They can troubleshoot problems on their own and begin to figure out novel problems-ones they haven’t faced before. They can begin to seek out and apply advice from experts and use it effectively.

Andy Hunt - Pragmatic Thinking
***
Proficient practitioners need the big picture. They will seek out and want to understand the larger conceptual framework around this skill. They will be very frustrated by oversimplified information.

Amdy Hunt - Pragmatic Thinking
***

Experts are the primary sources of knowledge and information in any field…The expert knows the difference between irrelevant details and the very important details, perhaps not on a conscious level, but the expert knows which details to focus on and which details can be safely ignored. The expert is very good at targeted, focused pattern matching.

Andy Hunt - Pragmatic Thinking
***
When you are not very skilled in some area, you are more likely to think you’re actually pretty expert at it.

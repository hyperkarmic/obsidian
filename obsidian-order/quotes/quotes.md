# coding quotes

#####  “**The competent programmer is fully aware of the strictly limited size of his skull**; therefore he approaches the programming task in full humility, and among other things he avoids clever tricks like the plague” - Dijkstra

####  “Increasing the efficiency with which a resource is used increases the usage of that resource” - Jevon's Paradox

#### _“If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in”_  - Dijkstra

#### _“There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third one works”_  - Alan Perlis

#### “Bugs lurk in corners and congregate at boundaries” - Boris Beizer

#### _“Increasing the number of choices will increase the decision time logarithmically”_ - Hick's Law

#### **A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.**  
— Saint-Exupéry

#### Computer programming is an art, because it applies accumulated knowledge to the world, because it requires skill and ingenuity, and especially because it produces objects of beauty." - Donald Knuth

#### Good code is its own best documentation _— S. McConnell_

####  “It is foolish to answer a question that you do not understand.”  - **“How to Solve it” by George Polya**

_“Programming without an overall architecture or design in mind is like exploring a cave with only a flashlight: You don’t know where you’ve been, you don’t know where you’re going, and you don’t know quite where you are.”_

_Danny Thorpe_

Programs are meant to be read by humans and only incidentally for computers to execute

— Donald Knuth
***
A programming language is a tool that has profound influence on our thinking habits.

— Edsger Dijkstra
***
> Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.

***
> I like my code to be elegant and efficient. The logic should be straightforward to make it hard for bugs to hide, the dependencies minimal to ease maintenance, error handling complete according to an articulated strategy, and performance close to optimal so as not to tempt people to make the code messy with unprincipled optimizations. Clean code does one thing well.

— _Bjarne Stroustrup_
***
> Clean code can be read, and enhanced by a developer other than its original author. It has unit and acceptance tests. It has meaningful names. It provides one way rather than many ways for doing one thing. It has minimal dependencies, which are explicitly defined, and provides a clear and minimal API. Code should be literate since depending on the language, not all necessary information can be expressed clearly in code alone.

— _“Big” Dave Thomas_

“Software is a place where dreams are planted and nightmares harvested, an abstract, mystical swamp where terrible demons compete with magical panaceas, a world of werewolves and silver bullets.” Brad J. Cox
***
“One of the paradoxes of defensive programming is that during development, you’d like an error to be noticeable — you’d rather have it be obnoxious than risk overlooking it. But during production, you’d rather have the error be as unobtrusive as possible, to have the program recover or fail gracefully.”

— [Steve McConnell](https://quotefancy.com/steve-mcconnell-quotes)

""**Code without tests is a bad code. It doesn’t matter how well written it is; how well structured it is; how well-encapsulated it is. Without tests, there is no way to tell if our code is getting better or worse.**""

**Michael Feathers in his book “Working Effectively With Legacy Code”**
***
the commonly accepted definition of legacy code is “code without unit tests”. - Michale Feathers
***
“Software architecture is all about appropriate compromises. For small projects, having a highly involved software architecture is probably an overkill. For large enterprise applications, it becomes a necessity.”

— Ash Isaac, [Software Architecture “Virtues”](https://dev.to/ashokisaac/software-architecture-virtues-22hj)
***
**“You should name a variable using the same care with which you name a first-born child.”  
— Robert C. Martin**

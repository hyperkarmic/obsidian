# 3 Layers

# Full-stack developers must be aware of the three layers.

-   **_Presentation Layer —_** The layer is responsible for the application’s front end or user interfaces.
-   **_Business Logic Layer —_** The business logic layer is the bridge between the presentation and data layers. It dictates how the application will behave, and the data exchanged.
-   **_Database Layer —_** This layer handles the database connectivity with the application’s back end.

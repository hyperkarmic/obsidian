**Component Library:****A component library is a set of reusable components you can use across your entire app. These component libraries consist of styled UI elements like buttons and texts. These UI elements are kept in a single repository or folder.**

Web components are interchangeable between frameworks and libraries because of their compatibility with a variety of tech stacks. They offer cross-platform development and ensure brand consistency. Web components allow us to break up a complex web app into reusable pieces that will reliably look and function the same, regardless of what they share a page with. They offer a consistent approach to interfacing with them via their attributes, and they are mainly focused on doing one thing well. Another advantage of web components is that when built on top of browser APIs/standards rather than frameworks, the JavaScript footprint of the design system is way lighter, which is key for site performance.

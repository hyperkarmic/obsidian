# User Centered Design
**User-centered design is an approach to design that puts users’ needs front and center and follows an iterative design process that focuses on the user’s needs every step of the way**. This means the design process is being influenced and guided by the user’s behaviors, values, and expectations from beginning to end.
***
In UCD, satisfying the user’s needs and responding to their feedback takes priority. Every design decision is judged on the value it has to the user and how efficiently it will help them meet their goals.

There are five main principles that guide user-centered design:

1.  Early involvement of end-users in the design process
2.  A clear understanding of the context of use and user needs in an attempt to align them with overall business requirements
3.  Regular collection, analysis, and incorporation of user feedback through the product design cycle
4.  Employing a user-centric approach to product development and delivery procedures
5.  Utilizing an iterative design process with a continual goal to improve user experience


User-centered design requires empathy, creative confidence, and the ability to learn from failure and adapt. The UCD process helps designers create emotionally impactful products that leave users feeling satisfied.
***
The UCD process typically consists of four steps:

### Step One: Understanding the user and context of use

This is where designers research who their users are, what problems they have, and contextual considerations that motivate or influence their use of the product. Designers determine what draws the user to the product in the first place and how they (would) interact with it.

### Step Two: Specification of user and business requirements

This step establishes why the design is beneficial for both the user and the business and the problems the design is solving. At this point, designers and stakeholders are finding what metrics to use for measuring business success (ie. expected revenue, ROI) and what success for the user looks like.

In this phase, it’s helpful to have a good understanding of [UX strategy](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/what-is-ux-strategy/), which helps to build a bridge between user needs and goals and those of the business.

### Step Three: Creation of design solutions

Next in the UCD process is the creation of potential solutions for the established problems. This is where the bread and butter of design occurs and contains processes like [storyboarding](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ui-design/what-is-a-storyboard/), journey mapping, wireframing, designing mockups and user flows, testing out different UI elements, as well as determining effective information architecture.

### **Step Four:** Evaluation of designs

Once the design team has come up with some possible solutions, it’s time to evaluate the effectiveness of their creations against the user and business requirements. **Usability testing** (ideally with actual users) is the most vital tool in this phase to determine how well the designs are performing.

Some questions to answer during this phase are; What went well? What went poorly? How did our users respond? How can we improve?
***
[User-centered design (UCD)](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/user-centered-design/) is **an approach to design that puts users’ needs front and center and follows an iterative design process that focuses on the user’s needs every step of the way**. UCD is used frequently in the product design world as both designers and business executives are reaping the benefits of incorporating their users’ needs into design decisions from the very first ideations to the final delivery.
***
The goal of user-centered design is to learn about the user and let their needs, values, and expectations guide the design process from start to finish.
***
Here’s are a few of the advantages of user-centered design:

-   Higher customer satisfaction and engagement
-   Provides cost and risk reduction as there is less chance of creating unsatisfactory products
-   Increases designer productivity and lessens the need for excessive re-designs
-   Keeps all team members focused on both the user and overall company goals
-   Creates a deeper sense of empathy
***
User-centered design is usually expressed as a **four-step process**:

1.  Understand the user and context of use
2.  Specify user and business requirements
3.  Create design solutions
4.  Evaluate effectiveness
***
This is probably the most important step of the UCD process. If you don’t know who your users are and the context in which they’ll be interacting with your product, it will be very difficult to design something tailored to their needs and personalities. Typically, information about the user is gathered using [qualitative UX research](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/qualitative-ux-research/)—which uses **surveys and interviews, focus groups, questionnaires, and more.**
***
When you’re trying to determine how users will interact with your product you’ll want to find out three things:

1.  The **medium** they will be using (ie. desktop vs. smartphone)
2.  The **environment** in which the interaction will take place
3.  Their **emotional state** at each phase in the user journey.
***
#### Business requirements

-   What is your expected revenue?
-   How much time and resources do you have to invest?
-   What is the scope of the design? (ie. major deliverables, milestones, deadlines, boundaries)
-   Who are your key stakeholders?

#### User requirements

-   What problems is the design solving?
-   What does a successful solution look like?
-   What has the user gained from using this product?
***
The term user-centered design was first coined in 1977 by computer scientist Rob Kling. It gained further attention and popularity as it was featured in Don Norman’s books [User-Centered System Design: New Perspectives on Human-Computer Interaction (1986)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1422802?seq=1) and [The Design of Everyday Things (1988)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/design-everyday-things-revised-and-expanded-edition).
***
In short, **user-centered design is** **an approach to design that puts users’ needs front and center, and follows an iterative design process that focuses on the user’s needs every step of the way.** While there is some focus on the requirements of the company, a majority of design decisions are made with the user’s expectations and needs at the forefront. The main goal of UCD is to create a product that is highly desirable and functional to the user.
***
There are five key principles that guide user-centered design and four main steps that make up the UCD process.

The main principles of UCD are:

-   Early involvement of end-users
-   A clear understanding of the context of use and user needs
-   Regular collection, analysis, and incorporation of user feedback
-   Employing a user-centric approach to product development and delivery procedures
-   Utilizing an iterative design process with a continual goal to improve user experience

### The four steps of the UCD process are as follows:

1.  **Understand the user and context of use:** This first step is all about researching your users’ behaviors, problems, and goals as well as how they might interact with your product.
2.  **Specify user and business requirements:** Here, you establish why the product is beneficial for both the users and the business, and find metrics to measure what success looks like to the company and the users.
3.  **Create design solutions:** Step three is all about storyboarding, journey mapping, wireframing, designing mockups and user flows, testing out different UI elements, as well as determining effective information architecture to design a product that solves users’ problems.
4.  **Evaluate designs:** Finally, you conduct usability testing (preferably with actual users) to test the effectiveness of preliminary designs, and determine what is working well and what needs improvement
***
**User-centered design focuses on fostering deep empathy with the population you are designing for.** The goal is to create solutions with users’ needs and feedback at the forefront of all design decisions.

User-centered design is a great approach when you want to design a highly desirable product for a specific audience.In the UCD process, the user is the focus from first ideation to development and release.

_There are four principles of user-centered design_

-   The active involvement of users during the design process and a clear understanding of the requirements of the user
-   Iterative design process
-   User centered design focusses on developing products that are easy to use
-   Multidisciplinary teams

The first step of the user-centered design method is the analysis. It is important to determine the purpose of the product and who your target audience will be. Also take a look at the products that are already out there and which functions do they offer. This will give you a better idea of how your product can be a contribution to the products that already exists.

In order to design a product that will meet the user’s expectation you will have to get to know your user. There are several methods to conduct user research. One of the most common used methods is interviewing. During the interview users are asked what their needs and requirements are regarding the new product. Surveys can be used to ask existing users what they think of the product and what their attitude is towards a new system. A focus group brings together a group of users that is going to discuss the product. Each participant can say their ideas about the product and the group can discuss this idea. The observer of the focus group can take notes of the discussion. A field-study can be very insightful. Users will simulate or walk you through situations in order for you to see how they handle these situations and where users have struggles during these situations. You will get to see where your product can be helpful for your users during these situations.

Based on the data you have gained during the user research you can make personas, user scenarios and use cases. This will give you a clear view of the users and how and when users will use your product. Personas are a representation of your users. A persona is given a name, a picture and some personal information. A design solution can be evaluated against the needs of a persona. User scenarios give a detailed description of a period of time in which the user will use your product. This will give you an understanding of how and when your product is going to be used and which requirements are needed. The use case will describe a task that a user performs step-by-step. This will give a detailed view of what the system does when the user performs an action. With this information in mind it is time to go to start the design process.

_Design_

The design of your products should be based on the research you have conducted. The design should meet the requirements that are formulated in the previous step. The design process is an iterative process, each step of the design process will be evaluated. After the evaluation the product can be further developed based on the outcome of the evaluation. The first few steps in the design process are conceptual, moodboards and wireframes can be created for example. After these concepts are further developed and evaluated, a high-fidelity prototype can be created. Users can test with the high-fidelity prototype.

_Evaluation_

There are several methods that can be used to evaluate your product, for example, the think aloud method, eye tracking, observation and a survey. During the think aloud method and the observation, users are given a few tasks they need to perform. The difference between these two methods is that during the think aloud method, users are asked to say everything that comes to mind during the performance of the tasks. During the observation the user does not need to talk, the observer checks how many mistakes the user makes and how long it takes to complete a task. The eye tracking method works differently. With eye tracking you can see where the user is looking during the performance of a task. Therefore you can see where your user is struggling to complete their task. The last method that can be used is a survey. Users will test your product and afterwards they will fill out a survey with questions about the product and how their experience was using the product.

_Implementation_

The last step in the design process is finalizing the high-fidelity prototype based on the evaluation. After the product is finished it is time for the last step of user-centered design: the implementation. And even after the implementation of the product it is wise to evaluate your product.
***
**Advantages of user-centered design**

The advantage of the user-centered design method is that the user is involved in the development process of a product. You will get a deeper understanding of the user and their needs and expectations. The product that is created is therefore more easy to use and will give users a better user experience. Users are likely to make less errors and can work more effectively with your product.

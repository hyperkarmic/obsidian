**UX Design (User Experience Design):** is all about enhancing user satisfaction and designing the complete user experience. UX requests a solid understanding of sociology, psychology as well as design to identify and address the real user problems. Also it requires tactical skills, including concept iteration, user research, prototyping and usability testing. One of the most critical skills for UX designers would be communication.

UX: After over a decade of experience, I can tell you that UX is essentially one thing, and one thing only: **expectations vs outcomes.**
<hr>
**UX:****The whole point of UX is to understand current expectations vs outcomes, and to design a process by which a person can exceed these expectations by out-performing their previous outcomes in terms of emotional, utility, and convenience values.**

UX: The term User Experience refers to how users interact with a product or service. Whenever you login into a website, or play a game on your phone, your interaction with that application is considered user experience.

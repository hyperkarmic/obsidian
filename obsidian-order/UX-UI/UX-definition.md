# UX

A user’s interaction with the **UI** with a focus on how satisfying and successful the experience is.

##### UX:UX designs the user experience by thinking about how the user will interact with the software and making it pleasant and optimal for the target audience.
<hr>
**UX Design (User Experience Design):** is all about enhancing user satisfaction and designing the complete user experience. UX requests a solid understanding of sociology, psychology as well as design to identify and address the real user problems. Also it requires tactical skills, including concept iteration, user research, prototyping and usability testing. One of the most critical skills for UX designers would be communication.
<hr>
UX: After over a decade of experience, I can tell you that UX is essentially one thing, and one thing only: **expectations vs outcomes.**
<hr>
**UX:****The whole point of UX is to understand current expectations vs outcomes, and to design a process by which a person can exceed these expectations by out-performing their previous outcomes in terms of emotional, utility, and convenience values.**

UX: The term User Experience refers to how users interact with a product or service. Whenever you login into a website, or play a game on your phone, your interaction with that application is considered user experience.

UX focuses on a user's experience using a product or service.

-   **Researching** - Involves conducting user research to identify goals, needs, and behaviors while interacting with the product.
-   **Ideating** - Involves designing [customer journey map](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/customer-journey-map) of how a user interacts with a product.
-   **Designing** - UX designers translate a concept into a rough draft by creating [wireframes and prototypes.](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/ux-tools-wireframing-and-prototyping-tools). They use software such as Figma, Sketch, among others.
-   **Communicating** - Collaborate with stakeholders, UI designers, and developers.

 [UX draws out the map](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/what-is-user-experience-ux-design-everything-you-need-to-know-to-get-started/), the bare bones. UI then fleshes them out with visual, interactive touch points that take the user through their journey as intuitively as possible.
 ***
 Every time you interact with a product, a software, or an object, you are experiencing that as a user of that product. [A UX designer’s job](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/ux-designer-job-descriptions-guide/) is to be the glue that holds the entire product team together, handing designs over to developers who will then implement them.

 1.  If the goal of the user is met, then they have a great experience of that product. They find what they are looking for quickly and easily.
1.  When a user has a great experience, they are more likely to buy or return to a product as well as recommend it to their friends.
2.  When a user buys the product, returns to the site, or recommends it to their friends, the traffic and conversion rate for that site are both increased.

As interest in the field has grown, “UX” has become more of an umbrella term for a number of different fields, such as **User Research, Information Architecture, Usability Engineering, Service Design**, and so on.

***

**UX design is primarily a **people-orientated profession**, and therefore a key UX design skill is the ability to understand the needs and behaviors of the user of the site, application, or product. The UX designer then seeks to align those needs and desires to the business goals of the company they are working for. And, as we mentioned earlier, the UX designer is always seeking to make each action **useful, usable, and delightful** for the user.**

***
_“Good UX designers fundamentally care about people. They feel uneasy whenever they know that their customers are being inconvenienced or are struggling and they use this unease to guide them towards relieving the customer’s pains. Moreover, good UX designers don’t lose sight of the fact that on their way to making people’s lives better, they will need to meet clearly defined business goals, as well.”_

[Dan Saffer, the interaction designer and author](http://www.odannyboy.com/), gave us another key piece of advice:

> _“Never forget the WHY: Why you’re designing this product, why people will use it, why you made the design decisions you did. Document the Why. Explain it to whomever will listen. Put it in your wireframes and in presentations. The Why should drive everything, because it’s what gives the product meaning, a story, a theme.”      

#### Information Architecture

> _“It is important to get people you work with to make important decisions on language and structure. When people in your organization are using different words to describe the same thing, beware. Unresolved semantic and taxonomic arguments often result in unneeded increases in scope and complexity.”_ —Abby Covert, President at IA institute and author of How to Make Sense of Any Mess

A user who is overwhelmed by too much information or gets ‘lost’ navigating through a site is going to have a **bad experience of that product, brand, or service**. To avoid these scenarios, a process called **Information Architecture** is carried out by the UX team as part of the UX design process.
***
When training in UX design, it’s crucial you observe the actions the user takes without intruding on or influencing their actions or decisions. Some UX designers conduct usability testing by asking the participants to talk through their actions out loud as they are making them, which gives the UX team an even greater insight into what is going on in the user’s mind while they are using the product.



***
Within a start-up, a UX designer can be responsible for every part of every process, due to small budgets, small teams, and limited resources. At a start-up, a UXer (you can call yourself that) is likely to oversee a project from beginning to end and actively take on separate processes including user research, testing, and design all by themselves.

However, within a larger corporation, a UX designer could be heading up a team of user researchers, overseeing testing, and acting in more of a managerial role. In this way, the UX designer is still overseeing the process from beginning to end, but they are much less hands-on.
***
The important thing to bear in mind is that how you view these pros and cons depends on your **work style, your personality, needs, and goals.** As a UX designer you’re working with management, other designers, developers, testers, marketing, support and more besides. **You’re the interface and the glue between all these stakeholders** and sometimes you’re the only one who **focuses on the user** (other stakeholders sometimes have other motivations). While you cannot get everybody to agree on everything, the best thing you can do is to get everybody to agree on a **user-centered design process.** Whether at a startup or a big corporation, as long as everybody follows this, then you’re in a great position to succeed!

User experience (UX) refers to any interaction a user has with a product or service. UX design considers each and every element that shapes this experience, how it makes the user feel, and how easy it is for the user to accomplish their desired tasks.

This could be anything from how a physical product feels in your hand, to how straightforward the checkout process is when buying something online. The goal of UX design is to create easy, efficient, relevant and all-round pleasant experiences for the user.

> “User experience encompasses all aspects of the end-user’s interaction with the company, its services, and its products.”  
> **— Don Norman, Cognitive Scientist & User Experience Architect**

UX designers combine market research, product development, strategy and design to create seamless user experiences for products, services and processes.

They build a bridge to the customer, helping the company to better understand—and fulfil—their needs and expectations.

> “How do I explain what I do at a party? The short version is that I say I humanize technology.”  
> **— Fred Beecher, Director of UX, The Nerdery**


***
As a UX designer, it’s your job first and foremost to advocate for the end user or customer. Whether you’re designing a brand new product, coming up with a new feature, or making changes to an existing product or service—the UX designer must consider what’s best for the user and the overall user experience.

At the same time, you are also responsible for making sure that the product or service meets the needs of the business. Does it align with the CEO’s vision? Will it help to increase revenue or retain loyal customers?
***
The UX design process is highly iterative, and a career in UX is as much about collaboration and coordination as it is about design.

But what does user-centered content actually look like? Thankfully, there’s general agreement in the industry about this.. User-centered content is:

-   Clear
-   Concise
-   Consistent
-   Actionable
***
-   **UX researcher:** Creates user needs/goals, personas, establishes which features should be prioritized, gathers evidence and research for design decisions—why the product should look and feel the way it does
-   **UX/UI designer:** Uses this research to gain insights and to come up with creative solutions to design problems; creates wireframes and/or prototypes to test these solutions to ensure that they will actually  the user to accomplish their goals as easily as possible
-   **UX writer:** Creates the words to gel with all of these components, creating a conversation within the product experience that—again—helps users to achieve their goals as easily as possible
***
To wrap up, here are some key takeaways on UX writing and how it relates to UX design:

-   UX writing is the process of creating the words that help the user accomplish their goals, and making sure they appear where and when the user needs them
-   UX copy or content is clear, concise, consistent and actionable; it always moves the user forward
-   UX writers collaborate closely with UX designers, UX researchers, and Product or Project Managers
-   UX writers are data and research-driven and follow the same UX principles as designers and researchers.
-   If you’re a UX designer, UX writing skills could make you more employable—especially if you’re looking to join a start-up or small business— and help you think about your product in a broader way.

A key part of user experience is providing easy opportunities for users to interact that they enjoy and understand.

# UX is User Experience

As the name says, UX is what the user experiences in the product or the application. Designing doesn't mean just to make things visually good, but the most important aspect of designing is problem-solving.

UX is multi-step strategic design process, so that customer /user, find easy to use and quickly understand the flow of the application. It is about how something looks, feels and works well. It is the one to decide the workflow and handles the procedural part of the application. It is responsible to make the application reliable, it just doesn’t deal with the aesthetics.

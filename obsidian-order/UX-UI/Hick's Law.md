# Hick's Law
[Hick’s Law](https://lawsofux.com/hicks-law/) says that the time it takes to make a decision increases when there are more choices.
***
The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices.
***
1.  Minimize choices when response times are critical to increase decision time.
2.  Break complex tasks into smaller steps in order to decrease cognitive load.
3.  Avoid overwhelming users by highlighting recommended options.
4.  Use progressive onboarding to minimize cognitive load for new users.
5.  Be careful not to simplify to the point of abstraction.
***
Hick’s Law (or the Hick-Hyman Law) is named after a British and an American psychologist team of William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman. In 1952, this pair set out to examine the relationship between the number of stimuli present and an individual’s reaction time to any given stimulus. As you would expect, the more stimuli to choose from, the longer it takes the user to make a decision on which one to interact with. Users bombarded with choices have to take time to interpret and decide, giving them work they don’t want.

This law makes sure that the product is not confusing and misleading for the users. It can be done by **providing them with a concise set of options or by breaking down complex tasks into smaller steps**. This can also be performed by highlighting the recommended options for the users.

> **Rule of Thumb for UX: More Options, More Problems.**

Hick’s law reflects a Usability Principle in UX i.e KISS: Keep it Simple, Stupid. This comes out that the users want everything on point, simple and straightforward.

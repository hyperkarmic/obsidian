# usability 

**Usability is the ease of use and learnability of a human-made object.**

This concept ties in directly with part one of why we use UX design—because it improves the experience a user has with a product. The easier a product is to use and learn, the better the user’s experience with it.

However, before a product is easy to use, it has to actually solve a user’s problem. More often than not, this is also the job of the UX designer: to figure out what users actually need.

Meterics of usability
-   **Learnability.** How quickly are first-time users able to understand basic navigation and functions?
-   **Efficiency.** Can users perform tasks relatively quickly?
-   **Memorability.** When users go away for a while and come back, how quickly can they reacquaint themselves with the basic navigation and functions?
-   **Errors.** What errors do users make? How severe are the errors? How easily can users understand and rebound from those errors?
-   **Satisfaction.** How much do users enjoy the interface and completing tasks within it? (Both as they are using the product and how they report satisfaction afterwards.)

**Usability** refers to how easy a product is to use—how easily you can accomplish a given task with the product. **UX** refers to the overall experience users have with the product, from beginning to end.

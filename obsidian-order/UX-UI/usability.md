# usability 

**Usability is the ease of use and learnability of a human-made object.**

This concept ties in directly with part one of why we use UX design—because it improves the experience a user has with a product. The easier a product is to use and learn, the better the user’s experience with it.

However, before a product is easy to use, it has to actually solve a user’s problem. More often than not, this is also the job of the UX designer: to figure out what users actually need.

### Universal design (UD)

As [motivational speaker Molly Burke explains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kIfwE4vJrI&list=PL_Xm8PicNxr0PeFjdxoW3o6grBYFrt_tH&index=9), universal design is the practice of “designing and building everything to be accessed, enjoyed and understood to its fullest extent, by everyone, regardless of their size, their age, their ability, or their perceived ability.”

Universal design follows seven key principles:

1.  **Equitable use:** The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities.
2.  **Flexibility in use:** The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities.
3.  **Simple and intuitive use:** Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user’s experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level.
4.  **Perceptible information:** The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user’s sensory abilities.
5.  **Tolerance for error:** The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions.
6.  **Low physical effort:** The design can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue.
7.  **Size and space for approach and use:** Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of user’s body size, posture, or mobility.

 Ranald Mace’s concept of Universal Design which is “_the design of products to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design.”_

In [“Accessibility for Everyone”](https://abookapart.com/products/accessibility-for-everyone) Laura Kalbag explains that the difference between accessible and universal design is subtle but important. An accessible designer would create a large door for people on a wheel chair to enter, while a universal designer would produce an entry that anyone would fit disregarding of their abilities.

## 1. What is universal design?

[Universal design was first defined in 1997](https://projects.ncsu.edu/ncsu/design/cud/about_ud/udprinciplestext.htm) by “a working group of architects, product designers, engineers and environmental design researchers” at The Center for Universal Design at North Carolina State University as: “The design of products and environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design.”

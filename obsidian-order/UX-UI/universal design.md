# Universal Design
### Universal design (UD)

As [motivational speaker Molly Burke explains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kIfwE4vJrI&list=PL_Xm8PicNxr0PeFjdxoW3o6grBYFrt_tH&index=9), universal design is the practice of “designing and building everything to be accessed, enjoyed and understood to its fullest extent, by everyone, regardless of their size, their age, their ability, or their perceived ability.”

Universal design follows seven key principles:

1.  **Equitable use:** The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities.
2.  **Flexibility in use:** The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities.
3.  **Simple and intuitive use:** Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user’s experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level.
4.  **Perceptible information:** The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user’s sensory abilities.
5.  **Tolerance for error:** The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions.
6.  **Low physical effort:** The design can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue.
7.  **Size and space for approach and use:** Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of user’s body size, posture, or mobility.

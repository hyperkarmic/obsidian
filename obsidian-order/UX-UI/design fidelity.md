# ZeroÂ UI

New design paradigm that does away with the traditional graphic interface and uses interactions through touch, context, the environment, gestures, and voice-recognition, amongst other elements. Connected devices of the Internet of Things ([IOT](https://www.zorraquino.com/en/dictionary/internet/what-is-iot.html "IOT")) such as Amazon Echo, Microsoft Kinect, or the Nest thermostat are examples of interfaces designed with this new model. The term Zero UI was proposed in 2015 by Andy Goodman, ex-director of the innovation and design consultancy group Fjord, who predicted the progressive elimination of screens as devices move over to systems based on touch (wearables), environment sensors (presence, noise, temperature, etc.) and automated functions.

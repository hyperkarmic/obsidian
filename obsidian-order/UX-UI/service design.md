# service design

Working methodology focussing on the needs, aspirations, concerns, and interests of those who are going to use a service when it comes to defining what that service will be like. For this purpose, the points of interaction with the client (known as touchpoints) are examined, identified, and understood so as to then be able to design a service that is tailored to the needs of the client and that truly provides value. With the growth and consolidation of services as an economic sector and the advent of digital technology, service design is an up-and-coming discipline. The term service design was coined in 1982 by the banking executive Lynn Shostack in an article published in the European Journal of Marketing.

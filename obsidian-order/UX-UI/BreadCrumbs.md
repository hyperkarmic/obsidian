You’re likely already familiar with the phrase “follow the breadcrumbs”, which means to follow a scattered series of clues back to a person or place.

**In the world of UI, “breadcrumbs” means much the same thing.**

Like the trail of breadcrumbs left by Hansel and Gretel so they wouldn’t get lost in the woods, UI breadcrumbs are a navigational tool that website and app users might get lost without! 

So what are the different varieties of UI breadcrumbs, and when should they be used or avoided? 

This article will give you the full lowdown on best practices for breadcrumbs and demonstrate their use in a selection of inspirational examples.

## 1. What are UI breadcrumbs?

UI breadcrumbs are a standard wayfinding device that enables users to easily navigate their way between different sections within the hierarchical structure of a user interface or website. 

These breadcrumbs often appear as a family tree of links, which indicate the current page, and its ancestors (the page that came before it, the one before that, and so on). 

A link to the home page should appear as the root node in this chain, with the subsequent pages separated by a symbol, such as “/” or “>”. This breadcrumb trail usually sits just under the website’s global navigation, or main menu.

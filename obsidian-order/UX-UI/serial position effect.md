# Serial Position Effect
> “Users have prosperity to best remember the first and last item in the series.”

This law states that **the human mind can store the first and last item of the series in its long-term working memory**, Hence it is suggested to keep the important matters either at last or at first and place the least significant item in the middle.

For a practical example, we can refer to the **navigation bar of Instagram**. The **Home button** is in the first place and the **Profile button** is at last. The most important and core parts of the use of the application. Positioning key actions on the far left and right within elements such as navigation can increase memory.

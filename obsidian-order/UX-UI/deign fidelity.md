# design fidelity
It refers to the level of details and functionality built into a prototype of the project. They are basically of three types :

-   **Low Fidelity:** Pen and paper are used to draw the basic skeleton of the application after a huge amount of brainstorming and research.
-   **Mid Fidelity:** Different software tools are used to make the final structure of the product and positioning of elements in the app.
-   **High Fidelity:** It is the final User Interface of the product along with the final color scheme and visual interface.

# Law of Prägnanz

> “People will perceive and interpret ambiguous or complex images as the simplest form possible, because it is the interpretation that requires the least cognitive effort of us.”

Also known as **“Law of Simplicity”**, which confronts that people opt for simple and ordered shapes rather than any complex structure because the interpretation of simple shapes requires less mental efforts. Hence, when confronted with complex shapes, we tend to reorganize them into simpler components or a simpler whole.

**Ever Wondered? Why most of the buttons are rectangular? Why don’t people try other shapes like a rhombus, pentagon, etc for a button?**

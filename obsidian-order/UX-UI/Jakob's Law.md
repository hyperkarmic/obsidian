## Jakob’s Law

[Jakob’s Law](https://www.zorraquino.com/en/dictionary/ux/what-is-jakobs-law.html), named for the UX researcher Jakob Nielsen, states that users spend most of their time on other sites and as a result prefer sites that work the same way as the sites they already know.

Jakob’s Law has often been used to limit experimentation and encourage the adoption of common design patterns in the name of usability.

Principle of [usability](https://www.zorraquino.com/en/dictionary/internet/what-is-usability.html "Usability") described by Jakob Nielsen that recommends the use of familiar patterns in design in order to facilitate [user experience](https://www.zorraquino.com/en/dictionary/internet/what-is-user-experience.html "User experience"), because users prefer it when a site works in the same way as all the other sites they already know. According to this Law, originality would impair user experience.

[Jakob’s Law](https://lawsofux.com/jakobs-law/) states that users spend most of their time on other sites and, as a result, prefer your site to function like other sites by following familiar design patterns.

Even if your UX is rigorously tested and optimized, when other sites and services carry out their own research, they are testing against the background of younger technology, and the “other sites” Jakob Nielsen refers to begin to change. As a result, the UX of your site is gradually eroded.

> “Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.”

The best way to make something new is to take reference from some similar pre-existing products so that clients can understand what is it about and can associate with it properly. **By leveraging the existing mental model, we can build better User Experience** so that the user can focus more on the task rather than building any new mental model. That’s why it’s better not to be over-original or over-creative.

> **Do not make them think.**

Most of you would have noticed that in approx 90% of the websites, **the logo of the company is on the top-left corner**. Its because people have this regular fixation of finding the logo on that particular place. To accumulate these kinds of erudition that what people are already up to, a **5-second usability test** can be performed, with the help of which you can get the keynotes that what users tend to remember on its first shot, and hence use it for making superior User Experience.

# empathy
[Empathy is defined as](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/empathy) “the action of understanding, being aware of, being sensitive to, and vicariously experiencing the feelings, thoughts, and experience of another without having the feelings, thoughts, and experience fully communicated in an objectively explicit manner.”

It describes the ability to put yourself in another person’s shoes; to truly see the world through their eyes in a given context or situation.

In a social context, empathy is often what drives us to take action. If we see people suffering or struggling, and we are able to empathise with their situation, we are compelled to help relieve them in some way.

Designers need to build empathy for their users in order to take the right course of action. It’s important to understand how the user feels when interacting with a certain product or interface; does the layout of this website evoke feelings of frustration? What emotions does the user go through when navigating this app?

Empathy is considered the starting point for any design project, and constitutes phase one of [the Design Thinking process](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/design-thinking-process/). During the empathise phase, the designer spends time getting to know the user and understanding their needs, wants, and objectives. This means observing and engaging with people in order to understand them on a psychological and emotional level.

Empathic design caters to real user needs, rather than supposed “averages”. One of the main objectives of the empathise stage is to identify user needs and behaviours that are latent, or unarticulated.

Empathic research and design is not concerned with facts about the user, such as their age or location. Rather, it focuses on their feelings towards a product and their motivations in certain situations. Why do they behave in a certain way? Why do they prefer to do this instead of that? Why do they click here rather than there when presented with a particular screen or page?

The [Stanford d.school](https://dschool-old.stanford.edu/wp-content/themes/dschool/method-cards/interview-for-empathy.pdf) provides some excellent tips on interviewing for empathy, such as constantly asking “why?” (even if you think you already know the answer!), asking non-binary questions, encouraging storytelling, and paying attention to nonverbal cues. One of the most important things to bear in mind when conducting an empathy interview is that you need to be present and attentive.

He considers empathy more holistically, stating that people like to think that they possess this quality if they’re able to listen to others, but in actual fact it goes deeper than that.  Empathy is about giving, receiving and feeling unity with others.

Theresa Wiseman’s four qualities of empathy as being perspective taking, staying out of judgement (which she admits is really hard for most of us!), understanding another’s feelings, and then being able to communicate that you understand. I recommend it as a starting point!

# design thinking
Design was first thought of as a science or way of thinking by Nobel Prize laureate Herbert A. Simon in 1969. This concept has been accepted and expanded upon widely by a variety of designers, scholars, and practitioners over the years, but [IDEO](https://www.ideo.com/) has been credited with bringing design thinking into the mainstream—they even coined their own terminology and step-by-step process.

**Design thinking is a creative approach to innovation and problem-solving that takes design perspectives and processes and applies them to problems that designers don’t typically encounter.**

According to IDEO, design thinking looks for solutions to “wicked” (or complex) problems that are feasible (technologically possible), desirable (to the end user), and viable (cost-effective to the business).

[Design thinking is an iterative process](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/design-thinking-process/) consisting of five steps:

1.  **Empathize**: Develop an understanding of the challenges the system/users are facing through observation (ie. interviews, surveys, etc.).
2.  **Define**: Analyze data and clearly articulate the problem you want to solve.
3.  **Ideate**: Brainstorm a large quantity of diverse ideas that could serve as potential solutions to the problem.
4.  **Prototype:** Build a simulation of your ideas as prototypes to test as possible solutions.
5.  **Test**: Share and test the prototype with end-users for assessment then implement feedback into rapid iteration.

Design thinking is a non-traditional approach to problem solving and can be applied to a variety of industries to help strengthen their services, products, policies, or design processes. It can be used to develop solutions for end-users but can also help organizations reinforce innovation, boost creativity, and implement new strategies and concepts for better overall function.
***
**While design thinking also requires great knowledge of the user, it also takes technological feasibility and business goals into consideration.** This is a method that can be applied to more than just product development.

Design thinking is an approach used for practical and creative problem-solving. It is based heavily on the methods and processes that designers use (hence the name), but it has actually evolved from a range of different fields—including architecture, engineering and business. Design thinking can also be applied to any field; it doesn’t necessarily have to be design-specific.

#### The Four Principles of Design Thinking

-   **The human rule:** No matter what the context, all design activity is social in nature, and any social innovation will bring us back to the “human-centric point of view”.
-   **The ambiguity rule:** Ambiguity is inevitable, and it cannot be removed or oversimplified. Experimenting at the limits of your knowledge and ability is crucial in being able to see things differently.
-   **The redesign rule:** All design is redesign. While technology and social circumstances may change and evolve, basic human needs remain unchanged. We essentially only redesign the means of fulfilling these needs or reaching desired outcomes.
-   **The tangibility rule:** Making ideas tangible in the form of prototypes enables designers to communicate them more effectively.

##### Phase 1: Empathise

[Empathy provides the critical starting point for Design Thinking](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/empathy-and-ux-design/). The first stage of the process is spent getting to know the user and understanding their wants, needs and objectives.

This means observing and engaging with people in order to understand them on a psychological and emotional level. During this phase, the designer seeks to set aside their assumptions and gather real insights about the user. [Learn all about key empathy-building methods in our guide](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/what-is-empathy-in-design-thinking/).

##### Phase 2: Define

The [second stage in the Design Thinking process](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/stage-two-design-thinking-define-the-problem/) is dedicated to defining the problem. You’ll gather all of your findings from the empathise phase and start to make sense of them: what difficulties and barriers are your users coming up against? What patterns do you observe? What is the big user problem that your team needs to solve?

By the end of the define phase, you will have a clear [problem statement](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/problem-statement-ux/). The key here is to frame the problem in a user-centered way; rather than saying “We need to…”, frame it in terms of your user: “Retirees in the Bay area need…”

Once you’ve formulated the problem into words, you can start to come up with solutions and ideas — which brings us onto stage three.

##### Phase 3: Ideate

With a solid understanding of your users and a clear problem statement in mind, it’s time to start working on potential solutions. The third phase in the Design Thinking process is where the creativity happens, and it’s crucial to point out that the ideation stage is a judgement-free zone!

Designers will hold ideation sessions in order to come up with as many new angles and ideas as possible. There are many different types of ideation technique that designers might use, from brainstorming and mindmapping to bodystorming (roleplay scenarios) and provocation—an extreme lateral-thinking technique that gets the designer to challenge established beliefs and explore new options and alternatives.

Towards the end of the ideation phase, you’ll narrow it down to a few ideas with which to move forward. You can [learn about all the most important ideation techniques in this guide](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/what-is-ideation-in-design-thinking/).

##### Phase 4: Prototype

The fourth step in the Design Thinking process is all about experimentation and turning ideas into tangible products. A [prototype is basically a scaled-down version of the product](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ui-design/the-value-of-prototyping-in-ui-design/) which incorporates the potential solutions identified in the previous stages. This step is key in putting each solution to the test and highlighting any constraints and flaws.

Throughout the prototype stage, the proposed solutions may be accepted, improved, redesigned or rejected depending on how they fare in prototype form. [You can read all about the prototyping stage of Design Thinking in our in-depth guide](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/design-thinking-stage-four-prototyping/).

##### Phase 5: Test

After prototyping comes user testing, but it’s important to note that this is rarely the end of the Design Thinking process. In reality, the results of the testing phase will often lead you back to a previous step, providing the insights you need to redefine the original problem statement or to come up with new ideas you hadn’t thought of before

There are many benefits of using a Design Thinking approach—be it in a business, educational, personal or social context.

First and foremost, Design Thinking fosters creativity and innovation. As human beings, we rely on the knowledge and experiences we have accumulated to inform our actions. We form patterns and habits that, while useful in certain situations, can limit our view of things when it comes to problem-solving.

Rather than repeating the same tried-and-tested methods, Design Thinking encourages us to remove our blinkers and consider alternative solutions. The entire process lends itself to challenging assumptions and exploring new pathways and ideas.

Design Thinking is often cited as the healthy middle ground of problem-solving—it is not steeped wholly in emotion and intuition, nor does it rely solely on analytics, science and rationale; it uses a mixture of both.

Another great benefit of Design Thinking is that it puts humans first. By focusing so heavily on empathy, it encourages businesses and organizations to consider the real people who use their products and services—meaning they are much more likely to hit the mark when it comes to creating meaningful user experiences. For the user, this means better, more useful products that actually improve our lives. For businesses, this means happy customers and a healthier bottom line.

-   **Significantly reduces time-to-market:** With its emphasis on problem-solving and finding viable solutions, Design Thinking can significantly reduce the amount of time spent on design and development—especially in combination with lean and agile.
-   **Cost savings and a great ROI:** Getting successful products to market faster ultimately saves the business money. Design Thinking has been proven to yield a significant return on investment; teams that are applying [IBM’s Design Thinking practices](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/think/2018/03/design-thinking/), for example, have calculated an ROI of up to 300% as a result.
-   **Improves customer retention and loyalty:** Design Thinking ensures a user-centric approach, which ultimately boosts user engagement and customer retention in the long term.
-   **Fosters innovation:** Design Thinking is all about challenging assumptions and established beliefs, encouraging all stakeholders to think outside the box. This fosters a culture of innovation which extends well beyond the design team.
-   **Can be applied company-wide:** The great thing about Design Thinking is that it’s not just for designers. It leverages group thinking and encourages cross-team collaboration. What’s more, it can be applied to virtually any team in any industry.

Despite these similarities, there are certain distinctions that can be made between the two. For one, the impact of Design Thinking is often felt on a more strategic level; it explores a problem space—in the context of understanding users, technological feasibility, and business requirements—
***
If Design Thinking focuses on finding solutions, UX design is concerned with actually designing these solutions and making sure they are usable, accessible and pleasant for the user.
***
You can think of Design Thinking as a toolset that UX designers dip into, and if you’re operating within the UX design field, it is one of many crucial methodologies you’ll rely on when it comes to creating fantastic user experiences.

solutions that are:

-   Desirable for the user;
-   Viable for business;
-   Technologically feasible.
***
**The Design Thinking process puts the needs and requirements of the user first.** The first stage of the process is dedicated to building empathy with your target users and getting to understand their needs, expectations, and behaviours.

Next, you’ll focus on coming up with ideas which are quickly turned into prototypes and tested on real users. Inherent to the Design Thinking process is the early and frequent testing of your solutions; this way, you can gather feedback and make any necessary changes long before the product is developed.
***
-   **The Design Thinking process teaches people how to innovate and problem-solve:** While most of us are programmed to solve problems that readily present themselves, we’re not necessarily inclined to go looking for problems.  
    Design Thinking encourages creative problem-solving; it pushes you to redefine the problem space and seek out the challenge that’s really worth solving. This is especially useful in a business context—whether it’s designing a competitive digital product, optimizing internal processes, or reinventing an entire business model.
-   **The Design Thinking process fosters teamwork and collaboration:** As explained by the [HPI Academy](https://hpi-academy.de/en/design-thinking/what-is-design-thinking.html), “innovations and answers to complex questions are best generated in a heterogeneous team of five to six people.” The Design Thinking process brings multidisciplinary teams together, breaks down silos, and encourages people to collaborate and challenge their assumptions.
-   **The Design Thinking process offers a proven competitive advantage:** Design-led companies have been shown to [consistently outperform their competitors](https://www.elf.agency/news/2017/4/23/design-driven-companies-outperform-the-sp-by-219-over-10-years). As already mentioned, the aim of the Design Thinking process is to come up with solutions, products, or services that are desirable for the user, economically viable from a business perspective, and technologically feasible. This user-first approach coupled with early and frequent testing helps to minimize risk, drive customer engagement, and ultimately boost the bottom line.

### 1969: Herbert Simon and “The Sciences Of The Artificial”

In 1969, American sociologist and psychologist Herbert Simon published an article which is said to have laid the foundations for Design Thinking. In _The_ _Sciences Of The Artificial,_ Simon set out seven key steps for using design as a creative approach to problem-solving. This seven-stage model is highly reminiscent of the five-stage process commonly used today.

### 1973: Horst Rittel and “wicked problems”

Another key figure in shaping the Design Thinking process as we know it today is design theorist Horst Rittel. In the 1970s, Rittel coined the term “wicked problems” to describe complex problems which are tricky to define, have no set number of potential solutions, and tend to be symptomatic of another problem.

### 1991: The birth of IDEO

In the early 90s, international design and consulting firm IDEO was founded. IDEO is often hailed as one of the most instrumental figures in bringing Design Thinking to the mainstream. The IDEO Design Thinking model divides the process into three key phases: inspiration, ideation, and implementation.

### 1992: Richard Buchanan and “Wicked Problems In Design Thinking”

Richard Buchanan, another design theorist, connected Rittel’s wicked problems to Design Thinking in the early 90s when he published _Wicked Problems In Design Thinking._ 

### 2005: Design Thinking as a university subject

In the early 2000s, Design Thinking started to be introduced as a course at university level. A notable leader in this field was the Stanford School of Design (or the d.school) which began teaching Design Thinking in 2005.

Design Thinking is an iterative process in which we seek to understand the user, challenge assumptions, and redefine problems in an attempt to identify alternative strategies and solutions that might not be instantly apparent with our initial level of understanding. At the same time, Design Thinking provides a solution-based approach to solving problems. It is a way of thinking and working as well as a collection of hands-on methods.
***
 Design Thinking helps us in the process of questioning,  
• questioning the problem,  
• questioning the assumptions,  
• questioning the implications.  
• Significantly reduces time-to-market:  
• Improves customer retention and loyalty  
• Cost savings and a great ROI  
• Fosters innovation

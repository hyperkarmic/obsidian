# Don Norman
The term ‘user experience design’ was first coined by [Don Norman](https://www.jnd.org/) in 1995 while he was the vice president of the Advanced Technology Group at Apple. He said:

> “I invented the term because I thought human interface and usability were too narrow. I wanted to cover all aspects of the person’s experience with the system including industrial design, graphics, the interface, the physical interaction, and the manual.”

Norman also authored the book ‘The Design of Everyday Things’ which pioneered the prioritization of usability and function over aesthetics and remains highly influential in design circles today.

### Norman's model of emotions
-   Don Norman of the Nielsen Norman Group outlined three levels of emotional response to design that may be invoked when using storytelling techniques in UX design: visceral emotion, behavioral emotion and reflective emotion.
- 
-   **Visceral emotion**, which is emotion that we’re born with. In other words, these are the emotions that are innate to us as human beings, and that therefore we have little control over, including our proclivity to recoil from ugly faces or our attraction to shiny objects.
-   **Behavioral emotion**, which is the emotion we experience as we’re performing a given behavior. These are the kinds of emotions user experiences evoke all the time. As a user clicks through a website, for example, they might feel pleased after selecting a link that brings them to the page with the information they were looking for. In contrast, a user may feel uncertain if they go to an application with the intention of paying a bill but are unsure which option they should choose to successfully complete the task.
-   **Reflective emotion**, which is the emotion that happens as we reflect on past experiences. These emotions can include nostalgia or wistfulness, however when it comes to UX design, reflective emotion can also have broad implications about how users feel about a product and the likelihood they will use it again. For example, if a user wanted to sign up for a new social network, but was required to provide a great deal of personal information to do so and then found the network wasn’t appealing or useful for them, every time they hear anything about that social network they’re likely to react with disappointment, frustration or disdain.

All three of these emotional responses to design are useful to know and understand when incorporating story into UX design, because UX designers must consider if the story elements they’re integrating into their designs have the potential to invoke negative emotions at any of these three levels.

*Did you ever wonder why cheap wine tastes better in fancy glasses? Why sales of Macintosh computers soared when Apple introduced the colorful iMac? New research on emotion and cognition has shown that attractive things really do work better, as Donald Norman amply demonstrates in this fascinating book, which has garnered acclaim everywhere from Scientific American to The New Yorker.Emotional Design articulates the profound influence of the feelings that objects evoke, from our willingness to spend thousands of dollars on Gucci bags and Rolex watches, to the impact of emotion on the everyday objects of tomorrow.Norman draws on a wealth of examples and the latest scientific insights to present a bold exploration of the objects in our everyday world. Emotional Design will appeal not only to designers and manufacturers but also to managers, psychologists, and general readers who love to think about their stuff.*

# What is affordance?


Term used by the designer Donald Norman to refer, within interaction design, to the possibilities for action that are immediately perceived by user when presented with an [interface](https://www.zorraquino.com/en/dictionary/internet/what-is-user-interface.html "User interface") (e.g. a button or a link, in the case of web usability). Users’ perception of what they can and cannot do is influenced by their physical capabilities, but also by their previous experiences with similar interfaces, their goals, the design of the object… Likewise, the term affordance is used in disciplines such as perceptual or cognitive psychology, industrial design, or artificial intelligence.

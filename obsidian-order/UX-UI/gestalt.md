# Gestalt

### 1. ARRANGEMENT

Gestalt psychology shows how these elements below influence your visitors:

-   **Similarity** — people perceive similar objects as the same or at least part of the same concept.
-   **Proximity** — things close to each other are perceived as part of the same group.
-   **Continuity** — you want your visitor’s gaze to move naturally from one element to another.
-   **Closure** — an object that’s not entirely closed is still perceived as a whole because people’s brains will always fill in the gaps.
-   **Figure and ground** — people simplify images into the main objects they’re looking at (the figure) and the other elements (background).

**Figure and ground** is a concept drawn from [Gestalt psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology "Gestalt psychology") by [media theorist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_studies "Media studies") [Marshall McLuhan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan "Marshall McLuhan") in the early 1970s. This concept underpins the meaning of his famous phrase, "[The medium is the message](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message "The medium is the message")". The concept was an approach to what was called "perceptual organization." He began to use the terms figure and ground as a way "to describe the parts of a situation[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_and_ground_(media)#cite_note-:0-1)" and "to help explain his ideas about media and human communication.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_and_ground_(media)#cite_note-:0-1)" The concept was later employed to explain how a communications technology, the medium or _figure_, necessarily operates through its context, or _ground_.

## Symmetry

Gestaltism — a human behavior theory that describes how the mind structures and arranges visual data — suggests that human beings naturally create order out of the things we see.

To put it another way, our eyes tend to crave completeness and organization. This brings us back to the idea of symmetry. By definition, there is a balanced, harmonious quality inherent in symmetry, and when it’s present in design the result is the kind of consistency, order, and stability that we find in some of the world’s most notable brands.

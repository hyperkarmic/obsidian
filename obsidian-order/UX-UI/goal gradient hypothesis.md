# Goal Gradient Hypothesis
The [Goal Gradient Hypothesis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239776073_The_Goal-Gradient_Hypothesis_Resurrected_Purchase_Acceleration_Illusionary_Goal_Progress_and_Customer_Retention) assumes that the closer users are to their goal, the more likely they are to complete it.

It’s an attractive theory, especially in e-commerce, where it is often used to justify simplifying the initial purchase process and postponing complexity to move users along the funnel — a typical example is leaving shipping charges until the final step.

The goal-gradient hypothesis denotes the classic finding from behaviorism that animals expend more effort as they approach a reward. Building on this hypothesis, the authors generate new propositions for the human psychology of rewards. They test these propositions using field experiments, secondary customer data, paper-and-pencil problems, and Tobit and logit models.

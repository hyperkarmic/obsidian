# UI
## **UI** is the interface of interaction between the visitor and a computer.
##### **UI** is an integral part of **UX**. Without a polished **UI**, you will never be able to deliver a **UX** worth remembering.


<hr>
#### UI:UI design is about using the right typography, images, colors, and other visual design elements to give a look to an interface that is attractive and usable.
***
UI: **UI Design (User Interface Design):** is all about selecting the right interface elements, such as text fields, buttons, check boxes and drop-down lists, to create the tangible interfaces that users can readily understand and easily use.
***
Simply put, UI focuses on visual elements such as colors, typography, icons, buttons, and menu bars, to mention a few.
***
-   **Look and Feel** - This will include design research, customer analysis, graphics design, branding, and creating user guides and stories.
-   **Responsiveness and interactivity** - They work designing prototypes for the interface, animations, and other interactive elements, adapting the software to all screen sizes and implementation.

A good example is the ketchup bottle. The glass ketchup bottle has a good look but poor usability when it comes to squeezing the bottle, especially when the ketchup is running up. Contrarily, the plastic ketchup bottle with the top facing down is easy to squeeze, providing a much better experience. This is a classic case of good UI and poor UX affecting [usability](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/usability).
***
Put simply, UI is what you use to interact with a product, while UX is concerned with how this overall interaction feels
***
UI design focuses on the user’s visual experience. It determines how a user interacts with an interface—be it an app, a video game or a website. It’s all about how the user navigates from A to B via different visual touch points. Think tapping a button or swiping through pictures.
***

The [job of a UI designer](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ui-design/ui-designer-job-descriptions-guide/) is to design all the screens through which a user will move, and to create the visual elements—and their interactive properties—that facilitate this movement.
***
 A [good interface](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ui-design/mobile-app-ui-design-for-beginners/) requires barely any thought from the user.
 ***
 The UI designer is pivotal to this. They think about the human user and how the mind works. They use things like patterns, spacing and [color](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ui-design/introduction-to-color-theory-and-color-palettes/) to guide the user.
  ***
 "Intuitive” is the keyword here. Not only is the UI designer a creative creature; they also put themselves in the user’s shoes, anticipating what they expect at each stage. They then use this empathy to design visual, interactive elements that respond in a way that feels natural to the user.

Let’s say you’re using an app to look for a new apartment. One listing in particular catches your eye, so you click to view the gallery. A full-size image takes over your screen, captioned 1/5. You know there are more pictures, so you use your finger to swipe through the gallery. There were no instructions to do so—somehow, you just knew.

This is the work of the UI designer. They think about what the user will expect, and design the app’s interface accordingly.
***
 [UX draws out the map](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/what-is-user-experience-ux-design-everything-you-need-to-know-to-get-started/), the bare bones. UI then fleshes them out with visual, interactive touch points that take the user through their journey as intuitively as possible.
 ***
 UI design is concerned with all the visual and interactive elements of a product interface, covering everything from [typography](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ui-design/beginners-guide-to-typography/) and color palettes to animations and navigational touch points (such as buttons and scrollbars).

“UX is focused on the user’s journey to solve a problem; UI is focused on how a product’s surfaces look and function.”

# | UI is User Interface

> ‘It is like a joke if you have to explain it, it's not that good’

UI is basically the graphical layout of the application, through which the customer or the end user would interact with the product. The most important aspect of UI designing should be that it should be intuitive. For instance, when we compare Apple and Samsung, Apple is more preferable as it is more intuitive since it is more soothing, simple and has a consistent look and feel.

UI is concerned with the aesthetics and beauty of the product. It is responsible for the attractive and interactive nature of the application. In interface designing, the interface experience should feel like there’s a human on the other end, not a computer.

It deals with the screen layout, transitions, interface animations, and even single micro-interaction. It decides the color schemes and typography. It is mostly concerned with the look, feel, responsiveness and interactivity.
***
 Key points in UI Designing:

-   Branding and Graphic Development
-   User Guides/ Storyline
-   Customer analysis
-   Design Research
-   Adaptation to all screen sizes
-   Interactivity and Animation
-   UI Prototyping

#### What does UI design involve

Like user experience design, user interface design is a multi-faceted and challenging role. It is responsible for the transference of a product’s development, research, content and layout into **an attractive, guiding and responsive experience for users.**

We’ll look at [the UI design process and specific tasks that a UI designer can expect](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ui-design/what-does-a-ui-designer-actually-do/) in section four. Before we consider the main differences between UX and UI, let’s quickly recap on what user interface (UI) design is all about:

1.  1.  -   User interface design is a purely digital practice. It considers all the visual, interactive elements of a product interface—including buttons, icons, spacing, typography, color schemes, and responsive design.
        -   The goal of UI design is to visually guide the user through a product’s interface. It’s all about creating an intuitive experience that doesn’t require the user to think too much!
        -   UI design transfers the brand’s strengths and visual assets to a product’s interface, making sure the design is consistent, coherent, and aesthetically pleasing.

If you imagine a product as the human body, the bones represent the code which give it structure. The organs represent the UX design: measuring and optimizing against input for supporting life functions. UI design represents the cosmetics of the body; its presentation, its senses and reactions.

As Rahul Varshney, co-creator of [Foster.fm](http://foster.fm/) puts it:

> “User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) are some of the most confused and misused terms in our field. A UI without UX is like a painter slapping paint onto a canvas without thought; while UX without UI is like the frame of a sculpture with no paper mache on it. A great product experience starts with UX followed by UI. Both are essential for the product’s success.”

If you’ve got room for one more analogy, Dain Miller sums up the relationship between UX and UI design perfectly:

> “UI is the saddle, the stirrups, and the reins. UX is the feeling you get being able to ride the horse.”

***
With the skeleton of the product mapped out, the UI designer steps in to bring it to life. The UI designer considers all the visual aspects of the user’s journey, including all the individual screens and touchpoints that the user might encounter; think tapping a button, scrolling down a page or swiping through an image gallery.

While the UX designer maps out the journey, the UI designer focuses on all the details that make this journey possible. That’s not to say that UI design is all about looks; UI designers have a huge impact on whether or not a product is accessible and inclusive.
***
-   UX design is all about identifying and solving user problems; UI design is all about creating intuitive, aesthetically-pleasing, interactive interfaces.
-   UX design usually comes first in the product development process, followed by UI. The UX designer maps out the bare bones of the user journey; the UI designer then fills it in with visual and interactive elements.
-   UX can apply to any kind of product, service, or experience; UI is specific to digital products and experiences.

Helga Moreno, who put it rather eloquently in her article [The Gap Between UX And UI Design](https://onextrapixel.com/the-gap-between-ui-and-ux-design-know-the-difference/):

> “Something that looks great but is difficult to use is exemplary of great UI and poor UX. While something very usable that looks terrible is exemplary of great UX and poor UI.”

# user testing


Like User Research, Testing is a fundamental part of the UX designer’s job and a core part of the overall UX design process. UX designers test because it allows them to **improve upon the original product or site design** and to see if the changes they made during the ‘design’ phase stand up to scrutiny. It’s a great way to **eliminate problems or user difficulties** that were unforeseen in the design phase before getting started on the implementation phase, and can also be carried out once the product is live as part of a [UX audit](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/what-is-a-ux-audit/).

Ensure you test with real users who are not friends or family!

Testing is a misunderstood art, and start-ups and entrepreneurs are often put off by it because of concerns regarding cost and time. Some are just afraid to talk to real users. However, testing is not something you can afford to bypass, as even a simple round of testing could make or break your product idea. The time and money a company spends on testing at this stage will save infinite amounts of both later on. Despite what you may think, testing need not be either time consuming nor expensive. Not only that, but research has found that [testing with 5 users generally unveils 85% of usability problems.](https://www.invisionapp.com/blog/ux-usability-research-testing/)

#### Usability Testing

In-person usability testing is usually a one-to-one, moderated usability session. The idea is for participants (preferably in your target demographic or representative of your personas) to perform tasks using your product, site, app, or SAAS while the UX designer or the UX design team observes. The purpose of in-person usability testing is to identify problems or issues the user has with the interface and why these issues arise. The advantage of this type of testing over remote user testing is that the very actions the user takes, not just his or her opinions on a product, can be noted.
**Testing can provide great results with very little effort.**

When training in UX design, it’s crucial you observe the actions the user takes without intruding on or influencing their actions or decisions. Some UX designers conduct usability testing by asking the participants to talk through their actions out loud as they are making them, which gives the UX team an even greater insight into what is going on in the user’s mind while they are using the product.

## Remote User Testing

Remote user testing is an option for a UX design team when it’s not possible to reach users from the product’s target audience in a real-life setting. For example, they might be in a place (a tropical island for example) that is hard or expensive for the UX team to reach, or the participants are difficult to accommodate or schedule.

The participants, facilitators, and observers are all located separately but connected online. Although this can be a convenient way to perform user testing, this method dilutes the value of the results because the ability to interact with users face-to-face creates a higher quality and more accurate result. It is also harder to analyze the data.

_“Never forget to go back and check whether what you did actually worked. When you do research, it should consist of multiple design-research iterations. A single round of usability testing is always a dumb idea.” —_ _[Harry Brignull – 90PerCentOfEverything](http://www.90percentofeverything.com/about/)_

#### A/B Testing

A/B testing is a form of quantitative analysis comparing two live versions of a site, application, or email message. It attempts to make focused changes that produce a statistically significant difference in some well-defined user action. It requires a good understanding of statistics to correctly design the test and interpret the results. Experience is also required to pick targets for testing that are likely to produce valuable results.

Remember: A/B testing helps if you already have a product/service and need to improve it. But don’t start with A/B tests when you are still designing a product; perform user tests instead. Also, be aware that although A/B tests are great at producing “hard data”—great for convincing management, for example—not everything you design can be verified by an A/B test.

A/B testing (also known as split testing) is a method of comparing two versions of a web page, product, email, or system, and seeing which performs better. By creating and testing an A and B version, you can try new design changes, test hypotheses, and improve your user’s responses. The goal of a split test is to look at differences in the behavior of two groups and measure the impact of each version on an actionable metric.

Although A/B testing will tell you which of two designs performs better, it won’t tell you why. This is why qualitative testing is so important.

UX testing almost always works. But it is only profitable at scale.

# user flow
User flows are basic flowcharts which visualize the complete path a user takes when using a product, from entry point right through to the final interaction.
***
The concept of flow in UX design was first coined by the psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. He deemed it a highly focused mental state where the user is fully immersed in what they are doing and the task they aim to accomplish. It is often referred to as being “in the zone”. User flows help designers understand and anticipate the cognitive patterns of our users in order to create products that enable this state of flow.

User flows, UX flows, or flowcharts, as they are sometimes called, are diagrams that display the complete path a user takes when using a product. **The user flow lays out the user’s movement through the product, mapping out each and every step the user takes—from entry point right through to the final interaction.**
***
 A user flow is a visual representation, either written out or made digitally, of the many avenues that can be taken when using an app or website. The flowchart begins with the consumer’s entry point on the product, like an onboarding screen or homepage, and ends with the final action or outcome, like purchasing a product or signing up for an account. Depicting this process allows designers to evaluate and optimize the user experience and therefore increase client conversion rates.

 Each touchpoint on the [user’s journey](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/how-to-make-customer-journey-map-with-template/) is represented by a node in the flow chart. These nodes are characterized by shape, and each shape indicates a particular process. For instance, a diamond means a decision is being made and is therefore followed by “Yes” and “No” arrows. A rectangle indicates a task or action that needs to be taken, like “Log in” or “Purchase”.

 ### Create an intuitive interface
 ### Evaluate existing interfaces
 ### Present your product to clients or colleagues

 ### Task Flows
Task flows focus on how users travel through the platform while performing a specific task. They generally show only one path and don’t include multiple branches or pathways like a traditional user flow might. These are best used when the task being analyzed is accomplished similarly by all users. When using task flows, it is assumed that all users will share a common starting point and have no variability in the way the task is carried out.

#### wire flows
Wireflows are [a combination of wireframes and flowcharts](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/user-flows-vs-wireframes/). They utilize the layout of individual screens as elements within the diagram. Wireframes on their own help convey the layout and design on each individual page, but lack the ability to communicate the page-to-page flow of heavily dynamic interfaces. Wireflows add page context to UX flows, since what users see on each screen greatly impacts their experience through the app or website. Wireflows are especially great when creating mobile screens.
***
User flows focus on the way your target audience will interact with the product. They emphasize that all users might not perform tasks the same and may travel in different paths. They are typically attached to a specific persona and entry point. Therefore, when using this type of flowchart, you may have many different scenarios that start at different places. However, the main task or accomplishment is usually always the same.
***
#### User flows are considered part of your deliverables, the elements you provide to the client and design team when your product is finished. Presenting a detailed flowchart can help validate your design decisions to your colleagues. However, designs are constantly being revised and user flows may be revisited and edited if further research deems it necessary.
***
User flows are a great tool for any designer’s toolbox as they can assist in evaluating the efficiency and simplicity of your creative design. At the same time, flowcharts and UX flows assist other members of the design team and easily communicate the layout of an interface to partners and investors. By providing a visual representation of what consumers will encounter, you can ensure your users’ experience will be gratifying and free from frustration.

As [UX designer Jonathan Walker explains in UX Matters](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2020/07/building-narrative-into-your-user-interface-part-1.php), imposing sequence provides a structure that reduces users’ cognitive load. Another way to impose sequence is through workflows.

As [UX Writer Jessica Collier observes in re:form](https://medium.com/re-form/what-is-narrative-ux-9400664660af), “successful products have a point of view that narrates events to the user. Their voice is consistent but also dynamic. They don’t break character, but that character evolves as the product develops and changes.” In other words, if your brand is serious and businesslike, you wouldn’t want a goofy message to pop up whenever users make an error because it would completely undercut the products’ tone.

##  User flows:

It is a visualization or flowcharts of steps (interactions) a user needs to complete a specific task on a website or mobile application. It is also known as Taskflow.

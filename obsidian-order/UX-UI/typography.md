# Typographic hierarchy makes things work

Visual hierarchy can be divided into different parts. One of them related only to the copy elements is called typographic hierarchy. It aims at organizing copy content by dividing it into various types such as headings, subheadings, body copy, captions and others. The differences between the types of copy are set by regulation of family, sizes, width, and colors of fonts.

# Consider context and audience
Before you choose a font, you need to learn your client’s goals as well as needs and preferences of a target audience. Visual performance of fonts influences the first impression users get from the product. If the kind of font doesn’t fit the mood which the product aims at, there can be a misunderstanding with the audience.

# Deep attention to mobile typography

Designers often do the experiments with typography to make a project original. However, when it comes to mobile UI design, typographers are literally short of space. Mobile screens are quite small which sets a new challenge for designers to cope with restrictions without loss of sense and functionality. Mobile typography requires deep attention to the details from an appropriate size of fonts to compelling tracking and line length.

# Minimalism can’t hurt

Sometimes, when designers aim at showing all the facets of a digital product, they try to use lots of various styles and fonts all in a single design. As a result, they get a design overloaded with unnecessary distracting details and lacking a proper mood.

# Text needs to breath

Legibility level highly relies on how much space there is between letters, words, and text lines. Tracking, kerning and leading are the processes of white space adjustment between the typographic elements. White space is the area between elements in a design composition.

A lack of white space may end in the bad legibility of copy content because it is difficult to distinguish words which are placed too tight to each other. Appropriate white space brings a visual relief to users’ eyes and allows going easily from one word to another, from one line to the next. However, try not to overuse it otherwise it can ruin text unity.

# Build typography like a scientist, revise like an artist

Typography is a complex science consisting of many rules and regulations. Those who covered them are able to create clean working typography. However, it’s is not enough. Clients always require originality and emotion but it can’t be done only by following the written instruction.

Designers should never bury their artistic souls. Imagination and the sense of beauty bring the uniqueness in any project, even the most casual one.

# Colorful typography needs thoughtfulness

The topic is actively debated. Some think there is no room for color in typography and some claim it’s a must-have for good-looking design. There is no point in looking for the right side of the dispute because there is no accounting for taste. Nevertheless, colorful typography does exist and designers apply it quite often.

# Learn the basics of typography
Designers who don’t know the concepts and the anatomy of typefaces can’t use the potential of typography at the full strength. Everyone decides for oneself if they need to learn the science in depth but the basics is a foundation of every craft.

**Typography is the art of arranging letters and text in a way that makes the copy legible, clear, and visually appealing to the reader.**

It involves font style, appearance, and structure, which aims to elicit certain emotions and convey specific messages. In short, typography is what brings the text to life.

### Typography builds brand recognition

Not only will good typography enhance the website’s personality, but your users will subliminally begin to associate the typeface featured on your site with your brand.

Unique, consistent typography will help you establish a strong user following, build trust with your users, and help to carry your brand forward.

### Typography influences decision making

Typography has a profound effect on the way that users digest and perceive the information conveyed by the text.

Eye-catching type is much more persuasive than weak fonts that don’t reinforce the message of the text.

### Typography holds the attention of the readers

Good typography could be the difference between someone staying on your website for one minute or half an hour.

**A** **typeface is a design style which comprises a myriad of characters of varying sizes and weight**, whereas **a font is a graphical representation of text character**.

Put simply, a typeface is a family of related fonts, while fonts refer to the weights, widths, and styles that constitute a typeface.

### Contrast

Much like hierarchy, contrast helps to convey which ideas or message you want to emphasize to your readers.

Spending some time on contrast makes your text interesting, meaningful, and attention-grabbing. Most designers create contrast by playing around with varying typefaces, colors, styles, and sizes to create impact and break up the page.

### Consistency

Keeping your typefaces consistent is key to avoiding a confusing and messy interface.

When conveying information, it’s essential to stick to the same font style, so your readers instantly understand what they’re reading, and begin to notice a pattern.

While it’s ok to play around with levels of hierarchy to some extent, it’s good practice to establish a consistent hierarchy of typefaces (one consistent font for headers, another for subheadings) and stick to it.

### White space

Often referred to as “negative space,” white space is the space around text or graphics.

It’s often overlooked and tends to go unnoticed by the user, but proper use of white space ensures the interface is uncluttered and the text is readable.

White space can even draw attention to the text and provides an overall aesthetically pleasing experience. White space often takes the form of margins, padding, or just areas with no text or graphics.

### Alignment

Alignment is the process of unifying and composing text, graphics, and images to ensure there is equal space, size, and distances between each element.

Many UI designers create margins to ensure that their logo, header, and body of the text are aligned with each other.

When aligning your user interface, it’s good practice to pay attention to industry standards. For example, aligning your text to the right will seem counterintuitive for readers who read left to right.

### Color

Color is one of the most exciting elements of typography. This is where designers can really get creative and elevate the interface to a new level.

Text color, however, is not to be taken lightly: nailing your font color can make the text stand out and convey the tone of the message_—_but getting it wrong can result in a messy interface and text that clashes with the site colors.

Color has three key components: value, hue, and saturation.

A good designer will know how to balance these three components to make the text both eye-catching and clearly legible, even for those with visual impairments. Often, designers will test this by viewing the text in **greyscale** (without color) and making tweaks if the text is too dark or too light against the background color.

### Hierarchy

Establishing hierarchy is one of the most vital principles of typography.

Typographical hierarchy aims to create a clear distinction between prominent pieces of copy that should be noticed and read first, and standard text copy.

In an age of short attention spans brought about by social media, designers are urged to be concise and create typefaces that allow users to consume the necessary information in short amounts of time.

Hierarchy can be created using sizing, color, contrast, and alignment.

For example, if you have a line of copy with an exclamation mark icon at the beginning that is in red and larger than the previous copy, this is a visual clue to the readers that it’s a call to action.

The most typical example of typographical hierarchy is **size**: headings should always be larger than subheadings and standard text.

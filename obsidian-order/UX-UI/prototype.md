#### Prototyping

A prototype is a draft version of your site or product that takes you as close as possible to a good representation of your website and it’s user interface before any coding has begun. This allows UX designers to **explore and experiment with ideas as well as check functionality and usability** before any money is spent on full-blown development.

With the use of the prototype, the intention behind different features becomes clear, and the UX team is able to see how the overall design will work together and **repair any inconsistencies or errors**. By building a prototype of your design before further development, the UX team make a number of savings, in terms of both cost and time.

Additional benefits of prototyping:

-   You can quickly **try out your ideas** and test them with users.
-   They can be created with just a pen and some paper.
-   Once the prototype has been put together, it can then be used to gather even more user feedback and reactions from potential customers, so you can continue to **develop and improve upon the original idea.**
-   Changes can be made quickly and easily to a prototype, incurring minimal costs.
-   It can be used to **demonstrate your product** to management, clients, and other stakeholders so they have a clear idea of your intentions with the design.
-   Interaction is something that happens over time, not in freeze frames or still images. Prototypes allow you to **experience and interact with the design** for yourself in real time.

A prototype is simply a scaled-down version of your product; a simulation which enables you to test your designs before they get developed. Prototypes range from the simplest of paper models to the more realistic, high-fidelity interactive prototypes which closely mimic the final product.

Testing your prototypes on real users helps to highlight any design flaws before you create the final product. Several rounds of testing could take place before the design is completely right.

##  Prototyping :

The most basic definition of a prototype is, “ A simulation or sample version of a final product, which is used for testing before launch”. The goal is to test products before sinking lots of time and money into the final product as it provides the flow and the blueprint beforehand.

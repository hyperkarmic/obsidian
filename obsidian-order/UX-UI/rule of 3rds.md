# rule of 3rds
The rule of thirds is **a method of breaking up an image or design into different sections using columns and rows that form a grid**. The grid consists of three evenly-spaced rows and columns to make nine equal boxes that fit over the image.
***
While UX designers do rely on the rule of thirds grid for strictly visual appeal, they also use it to make sure users notice key point’s that will ultimately **help the user navigate the interface** and hopefully lead to **higher conversion rates**.
***
Usually designers will place important images, links, text, or calls to action near the four points of the grid so users can quickly get an idea of what they are looking at and how to proceed with main tasks.
***
The rule of thirds grid makes focusing and placing important images, text, or buttons a lot easier. It follows the natural pattern the human eye takes when scanning a field so the viewers or users are more likely to notice important information.

While the rule of thirds is great for creating balance and dynamism in designs or images, it’s important to remember it is merely a guideline and may be broken in certain situations.

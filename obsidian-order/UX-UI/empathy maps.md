## 1. What is an empathy map?

Empathy maps are an efficient tool used by designers to not only understand user behavior, but also visually communicate those findings to colleagues, uniting the team under one shared understanding of the user. Originally invented by Dave Gray at Xplane, the empathy map was made in an attempt to limit miscommunication and misunderstanding about target audiences, including customers and users.
Essentially, an empathy map is a square divided into four quadrants with the user or client in the middle. Each of the four quadrants comprises a category that helps us delve into the mind of the user. The four empathy map quadrants look at what the user **s****ays**, **thinks**, **feels**, and **does**.

Tool used in [design thinking](https://www.zorraquino.com/en/dictionary/digital-marketing/what-is-design-thinking.html "Design thinking") and that is distinguished by adopting the perspective of the user that the product or service is aimed at in order to identify his/her needs and expectations, including those that are latent, as well as the context within which they arise, so as to incorporate them into the design. In practice, this consists of an analysis of six aspects: What does the client think and feel? What does he/she hear? What does he/she do? What does he/she see? What are his/her pains? What are his/her needs? This information is then set out on a canvas in order to describe the ideal client.

# Storyboard
Let’s begin with the basics. A storyboard is a graphic portrayal of a narrative, concept, or script, divided into sequential scenes (panels). They are generally used to map out how a script or story will look once it is animated or acted out, but people utilize them for a variety of situations.

“Storyboarding” is simply the act of creating a storyboard. For the best results, you’ll need to strike a balance between providing enough visual information to be able to tell the story so others can understand it and making it overly detailed. Some storyboards can be very rough and simple; other times, they can be very elaborate. It depends on the situation, how much time you have, and what stakeholders (your team, clients, etc.) are looking to use them for (more on that later).

Stories are an excellent way to communicate information. They make it easier for people to understand complex concepts and tend to be more interesting than informative text. And since graphics are more straightforward than the written word, a storyboard can break down even more communication barriers. Given their versatility, it makes sense that people use them in a variety of situations.

Storyboarding helps ensure the message is on point and achieves the intended goal, and that the scenes all work together fluidly before moving onto any actual film production—which can save quite a lot of money in the long term!

A storyboard can help get everyone on the same page quickly. Humans process images a stunning [60,000 times faster than text](https://www.t-sciences.com/news/humans-process-visual-data-better), which means that no matter how brief you make your pitch or presentation, it will ultimately take longer for people to understand it because there are words involved. 

In addition to communicating ideas faster, a storyboard is also a great way to hone an idea without going too deep into further production. A script or a concept can sound amazing in principle, but you may create a storyboard and realize it just doesn’t translate well into visual scenes.

A storyboard is an especially important part of the animation design process. Just like for any video, it provides a visual map that communicates the script or narrative, but it can also include critical requirements that will give clients an idea of cost and time to produce. Establishing these parameters before moving forward into the drawing phase will lead to a much smoother process down the line, trust us! 

Finally, storyboards are also helpful to video editors, as they’ll be able to use them as points of reference to ensure the final cut adheres to the original vision.

## 3. What elements make up a storyboard?

A basic storyboard’s components are very straightforward. In their basest form, all you’ll need to start is a concept, script, or story—this forms the basis for what you are trying to communicate through the visualization. However, the most comprehensive storyboards will include several of the following components:
-   Dialogue or voiceover narration for each panel
-   Time frame for each scene, which are especially critical for animation and film because they set the stage for budget, the feel of the final product, and the resources necessary to bring it to life
-   Camera details, like the type of shot, camera location, and how to transition from scene to scene 
-   Aspect ratio

A storyboard is a tool used to turn a script, concept, or idea into a chronological sequence of drawings that help stakeholders comprehend what you are trying to explain. Storyboards are most commonly used during the movie production process for everything from blockbuster films to product videos to explainer animations, but you can also use them to pitch ideas or explain concepts in an educational setting.

### What are the elements of a storyboard?

Storyboards can range from elementary to quite detailed and granular, but there are several elements that most storyboards (especially those for movies) should include:

-   **Script or narrative**. Consider the script or narrative as the skeleton of your final product. Without a guide to follow, you’ll have nothing to base your storyboard scenes on. 
-   **Aspect ratio**. If you’re going to produce a movie, you’ll need to know the [aspect ratio](https://businessinsider.com/what-is-aspect-ratio) (the shape of your camera frame). Aspect ratios matter because not every platform uses the same one. For example, online videos, like those hosted on YouTube or social media, are typically 16:9 (sometimes 1:1 for Facebook and Instagram), whereas epic action films may fare better using a more robust 2.39:1. 
-   **Panels**. These are the rough scene renderings that transform your script into images (otherwise known as “the fun part”).
-   **Camera angles**. Varying your camera angles and shots is essential for keeping things interesting and engaging an audience. You can pan in or out, film using long shots, close-ups, from behind, etc.   
-   **Titles or captions**. These can include parts of the script, a description of the scene, or other additional directions for the production process.

### Tip 1: The more detailed your script, the easier it will be to storyboard

Think about it: if your script or concept is fully fleshed out, it will be easier to convert into visuals. If your narrative is still vague, you’ll need to spend time during the scamping phase to translate it into the scenes.

### Tip 2: Make sure your scenes make sense when you arrange them

If a character is sitting at a table in one scene, don’t have them sitting on a sofa without showing how they arrived there in the next. The nice part about storyboarding is that it forces you to account for these transitions, so you don’t find yourself at the end of a shoot with disjointed scenes, frantically trying to edit them into a semblance of fluidity. 

### Tip 3: Don’t be afraid to get precise about camera shots

The more detail you can provide to the production teams, the better. It will make their lives easier and ultimately give you more control over the end product.

### Tip 4: Think of the storyboard as a stepping-off point, not a finished product

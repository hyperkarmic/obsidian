# wicked problems

Coined by Horst Rittel, a design theorist, wicked problems are multidimensional and difficult to solve because they often consist of incomplete, contradictory, or changing requirements. These problems also tend to be interdisciplinary in that solving one can reveal—or even create another. For this reason, wicked problems require a problem-solving method that is collaborative, adaptable, and centered on the complexities of human behavior.

The human-centered design process consists of three overlapping phases: inspiration, ideation, and implementation. During the inspiration phase, you will immerse yourself in the lives of the people you are designing for in order to understand their needs. During the ideation phase, you will reflect on what you learned, then generate, prototype, and test possible solutions. The final implementation phase is the path that leads to change. It is during this phase that you will bring your solution to life, knowing that the very people who experienced the problem were a constant part of the design process and even part of the design team itself.

#### Phase 1: Inspiration

**  
Understand and Observe**  
Human-centered design starts with [empathy](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/empathy-and-ux-design/), an important part of developing understanding. Empathy, or the ability to share the feelings of those who experience the problem, is important because it facilitates insight into how you can generate solutions through what you design and create. The process of empathy and understanding can be facilitated through generative research methods, such as interviews, immersion, or guided tours.

**Point of View**  
After developing an understanding of human needs, the next step is to synthesize insights and define a point of view. Synthesis is the process of understanding how the insight gained through research translates into the features of a product or service. This process will allow you to move from data to information (what can or can’t the research tell us?), information to knowledge (the application of information to questions of “how” something could be done), and knowledge to wisdom (knowing what to do and why to do it). See [synthesis methods](https://speakerdeck.com/uxlondon/jon-kolko-methods-of-design-synthesis?slide=88).

#### Phase 2: Ideation

**  
Ideate**  
Ideation occurs after insights are synthesized into actionable needs and recommendations. The goal of ideation is to generate as many divergent ideas as possible. The psychological benefit of generating ideas, even if they are unfeasible, is the process of overcoming your inner critic, which often keeps you from uncovering disruptive or paradigm-shifting solutions. Research shows that the best ideas come from having a greater amount and diversity of ideas. See [ideation methods](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/what-is-ideation-in-design-thinking/).

**Prototype**  
[Prototypes](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ui-design/the-value-of-prototyping-in-ui-design/) allow you to test a design in the context of real use (or as close to it as possible). This provides more detailed contextual information needed to refine a solution. Prototyping is the best way to get a holistic understanding of someone’s experience in the context of use and is performed to answer key questions about business and product assumptions.

**Test**  
Testing involves validating important assumptions about a product design, [service design](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/what-is-service-design-how-to-implement-service-design-processes/), or business model. It also provides a way to explore strategic opportunities for greater value creation and revenue growth. In order to do this, designers create quantitative and qualitative usability metrics to understand what is working and not working. In human-centered design, the process of testing and iteration allows you to progressively improve a design to deeply align with the behaviors, goals, and needs of the user. See [usability metrics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-metrics/).

#### Phase 3: Implementation

Lastly, implementation is about delivering a refined version of a design into the world. It includes telling the story of your design through marketing or storytelling, launching a pilot, and implementing a business model to sustain what you have made. Continuous measurement during this phase allows organizations to evaluate, modify, or expand product features in order to create more value. Overall, implementation should lead to continuous adaptation and growth of a solution in response to needs, market trends, and user behaviors.

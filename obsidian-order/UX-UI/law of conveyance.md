## Law Of Conveyance
###  "__To help your users get to where they want to go, you need to make it abundantly clear what they need to be doing at every step in the process.__"

-   **Visually highlight the next step** they should take with color, size, and/or style. Make it stand out somehow from the rest of the page.
-   **Use supporting text** to assist the user in moving down the correct path, and to help them understand any points that may be vague or questionable.
-   **Use interaction patterns** that the user is already familiar with in apps that they more than likely already use (see Jakob’s Law; YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, etc.)
-   **Maintain good visual/information hierarchy** so that your content is scannable, with nothing else is directly competing for your users’ attention to the best of your ability. This can be in the form of typography, color, styles, and/or positioning of elements.

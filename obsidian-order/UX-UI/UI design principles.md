[## 1. Give users control
**What use is a vehicle if the controls don’t feel within reach and instantly intuitive?** Good UI design should give users an immediate sense of comfort and control. This will allow them to learn and master a product quickly and easily.

ie Navigation/Sign Posts/Feedback/Undo/Shortcuts

## 2. Reduce the load

As psychologist George Miller famously posited in 1956, the human brain is only really capable of holding on to around seven pieces of information at one time. 

This has significant ramifications for UI design, and the need to not overwhelm the user’s mental bandwidth as they navigate the product. To that end, this UI design principle has vital aspects to bear in mind:

7 is a magic number - no more than 7 elements at any  one time!!!

## 3. Design an efficient layout

The screen is the UI designer’s canvas, and an efficient layout on that screen is the bedrock of any product.

Emphasis.....Visual Hierachy....and White Space are key here!!!!

## 4. Be consistent

As with design in branding, consistency in UI design allows the creator to emphasize a clear message about what the product does, and how the user can use it.

Be predictable.  Make it familiar!!!!

## 5. Steer dialogue toward closure

Dealing with the concept of closure is the final key principle within your UI design. In a sense, it encapsulates the points we’ve touched on so far. 

Closure is the endpoint that product users are navigated towards. All signposts, feedback, and shortcuts should aid the user in reaching this conclusion. 

A feeling of closure can also be offered to the user following a burst of activity, using feedback. **Without the promise of closure, a product may seem overwhelming.**  

As Shneiderman puts it: 

> “Sequences of actions should be organized into groups with a beginning, middle, and end. Informative feedback at the completion of a group of actions gives users the satisfaction of accomplishment, a sense of relief, a signal to drop contingency plans from their minds, and an indicator to prepare for the next group of actions.”

## 6. Takeaways

UI design is the craft of engineering a smooth, enjoyable experience for users as they interact with websites and apps. As the art of UI evolves, a list of UI design principles has emerged that designers refer to when creating their work.

In short, these are the key takeaways from our list of the top five principles:

-   **Control** is key. Great UI design places users in the driving seat of the product, giving them the comfort and confidence to manipulate and master the experience from the get-go.
-   Good signposting and feedback allows the user to successfully **navigate** your product. 
-   Users **shouldn’t be afraid** of playing, exploring, or breaking the product. An anxious UI will limit navigation and slow down mastery of the interface.  
-   Implementing interaction techniques like **back** or **undo** buttons will reduce the risk of error in your UI, freeing up the user to experiment and make progress. 
-   Don’t burden the user’s **cognitive load** with too much information—remember Miller’s Law and the magic number seven.
-   An **efficient page layout** is crucial to good UI design.
-   Use techniques such as **emphasis**, **visual hierarchy,** and **white space** to help guide the user’s eye to the correct elements of your product.
-   Don’t reinvent the wheel: **consistency**, **predictability,** and **familiarity** are key ingredients of successful UI. 
-   Whether at the end of a section or the conclusion of your entire product, use the above tricks and tips to **steer dialogue toward closure**.

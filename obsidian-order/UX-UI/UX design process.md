UX Design process

### What steps make up the UX design process?

The UX design process can be divided into four key phases: **user research**, **design**, **testing**, and **implementation**. While the UX design process does typically take place in that order, it’s important to note that UX is an iterative process. As a UX designer, you’ll often hear the phrase “Design is never finished!” This is because, throughout the UX design process, you’ll uncover new insights that may lead you to rethink your design decisions so far. Expect to revisit and repeat certain steps in the UX design process as you continuously optimize and improve your designs.

1. **User research is integral to the UX design process. It is every UX designer’s starting point for a UX design project**. Research teaches us about the **users, their behavior, goals, motivations, and needs.**

It also shows us how they currently navigate our system, where they come up against problems and, most importantly, how they feel when interacting with our product.

**Empathy** is key here. You’ll be working with groups of users who come from a variety of backgrounds and are bringing different experiences with them. Your job is to try to understand why they are behaving the way they are, not to try to change that behavior or influence it, but accommodate it within the product.

_“Don’t confuse process for outcome—knowing UX practices like personas, flows, and wireframes is important, but not sufficient to delivering great experiences. More important is a UX mindset—a commitment to seeing the world from the perspective of your users and doing everything you can to make sure what you’re doing makes sense to them.”_

> _“Research is worth nothing if you don’t act on it properly. The leap between research insight and the design action is the most important part of a UX designer’s job.”_ – [Harry Brignull, UX consultant at 90percentofeverything.com](http://www.90percentofeverything.com/)

Mastering the UX design process means **always thinking from the perspective of the user**; learning what that perspective is can only come about through working with real users when performing **in-depth user research**.
***
[Jeff Gothelf](http://www.jeffgothelf.com/), the author of Lean UX, had this to say about user research:

> “Over the last 5 years the nature of software has fundamentally shifted into a state of continuous improvement and iteration. This provides designers with an amazing opportunity to turn this into a continuous conversation with your audience. Continuous conversation — small chunks of research done frequently and consistently — ensures the customer’s voice in our decision-making process. In fact, it ensures that research, as much as coding, designing or gathering requirements, takes its intended place in the iterative loop of product design and development.”

***
User research has to come first in the UX design process because without it, our work can only be based on our own experiences and assumptions; which are neither objective nor from our target customers.

User research gives us the data we need to begin building the product. We can’t proceed without that information—it’s a fundamental part of any **UX design project**.

By researching first, we save ourselves a lot of work, time, money, and resources further down the line, as fewer adjustments will need to be made. If we designed first and then researched after, we would have to incorporate huge changes into our designs to meet the needs of the users whom we have spoken to.

### What Is Involved In User Research?

It’s important to mark the distinction between **listening** to users and **observing** users. Both methods have their place in research, and both will provide you with valuable data.

The mistake many beginners make is to focus too heavily on listening, whereas observing users can uncover a lot more in less time.

#### Interviews

A user interview is an in-depth one-on-one discussion between an interviewer and a user from the target demographic. It is designed to discover the underlying needs and requirements of the user when using your product.

**A user interview** can also be conducted while a user interacts with your product; the interviewer can ask questions which reveal precisely what the user is thinking as they navigate. Ask your users about the problems they generally have with this kind of service and where their greatest pain points are.

You could even let them describe what their ideal product would look like if there were no limitations!

#### Online Surveys

An online survey is a questionnaire consisting of a set of very precise questions sent to a sample of your target audience over the internet—usually via a form.

Before you start writing your online survey, take the time to conduct a few persona interviews beforehand to fully understand the user’s ***problem space.***

#### Persona (Creation)

Personas are not the customers you want, but the customers you actually have or that are already out there. These personas are fictional but represent a selection of this real audience and their behaviors

#### User Testing

We will discuss user testing in more detail in the Testing section, but bear in mind that if you are improving a pre-existing product (rather than researching for a new design), user testing can be a valuable research resource to uncover where users are struggling with that product.

### 5. Design: Wireframing And Prototyping

The next step in the UX design process is to create wireframes and prototypes. This gives you something tangible to test on real and potential users, which is crucial in making sure that your designs are **usable**.

UX design process:

> _“Designing without conducting user research completely contradicts the concept of UX design. User research helps designers and stakeholders understand users and their needs and identifies the requirements of a product. Put simply, it removes assumptions from the design process, as it provides data to back up one’s design.”_

***
#### Wireframing

Wireframing in UX design refers to an illustration or diagram of a website, software, or app page that looks at:

-   The allocation of space on that page
-   The distribution of images and content
-   How content is prioritized
-   What functions are available
-   What behavior is intended and accommodated.

Wireframes rarely contain color, images, or styling because their job is to help the UX team understand and establish relationships among a website’s different templates. These templates need to be determined before any aesthetic considerations are taken into account. By focusing first on the navigation and structure of the site or product, a UX designer is far less likely to become distracted by the visual layer.

Wireframes can be as simple as a **pencil sketch on a piece of paper**, which you could later digitize to **create a prototype** or to add more detailed specifications.
***
#### Prototyping

A prototype is a draft version of your site or product that takes you as close as possible to a good representation of your website and it’s user interface before any coding has begun. This allows UX designers to **explore and experiment with ideas as well as check functionality and usability** before any money is spent on full-blown development.

### 6. User Testing

Like User Research, Testing is a fundamental part of the UX designer’s job and a core part of the overall UX design process. UX designers test because it allows them to **improve upon the original product or site design** and to see if the changes they made during the ‘design’ phase stand up to scrutiny. It’s a great way to **eliminate problems or user difficulties** that were unforeseen in the design phase before getting started on the implementation phase, and can also be carried out once the product is live as part of a [UX audit](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/what-is-a-ux-audit/).

### 7. How Does User Testing Work?

User testing is conducted through a variety of means:

-   Simple observations
-   Questionnaires
-   Surveys
-   Interviews

### 8. Implementation Of The UX Design Process

As a UX designer, it is your responsibility to implement, and advocate for, the UX design process.

Remember: [UX design is a process](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/the-ux-design-process-an-actionable-guide-to-your-first-job-in-ux/), and wireframing isn’t the first step in this process. Before you even think about picking up a pen and paper, you need to have covered the first two steps; namely understanding who your audience is by way of user research, detailing requirements, [creating user personas](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/how-to-define-a-user-persona/) and defining use cases, and complementing this with further competitor and industry research.
***this, they conduct extensive research and competitor analysis in order to fully grasp the problem or challenge they are setting out to solve. This involves interviewing those who are, or will be, directly engaged with the product.

The designer then uses this feedback to identify the user’s goals, emotions, pain-points and behaviors. All of this information helps to form [user personas](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/how-to-define-a-user-persona/). The next step is to consider what these personas are trying to accomplish when using a particular product, and the journey they will take to do so. The designer considers information architecture and uses various techniques, such as [card sorting](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/what-is-card-sorting/), to map out user flows.

Once the user flows have been determined, the designer knows what steps the user needs to take to complete their desired tasks. They will visually brainstorm solutions for each of these steps, [creating wireframes](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/how-to-create-your-first-wireframe/) and prototypes of what the final product might look like.

With prototypes to hand, the UX designer will then conduct usability tests to see how users interact with the product. This shows whether or not the user is able to complete their desired tasks, or if changes need to be made.

# Visual Hierachy
**Visual Hierarchy**Â is also one of the most crucial components of an amazingÂ **UI**. There is a great quote by aÂ _Great Developer_Â (read: By Me ðŸ˜œ):

> A great developer is someone who makes implied actions evident

**Visual Hierarchy**Â is used to highlight certain parts of the Website which you want the users to focus on. You can employ several tactics for making users focus on a part of the site.

One of the most straightforward design principles to understand is hierarchy: bigger is more important, i.e., a heading is visually stronger than a sub-heading, a sub-heading is visually stronger than the body text.

## 1. Limit yourÂ typefaces

## 2) Complement and contrast

PairingÂ [serifs and sans-serifs](http://www.signazon.com/serif-vs-sans-serif-typefaces)Â is a ubiquitous principle of design. This is because the complex, interesting and often elegant serifs mesh well with the simple, clear sans serifs, creating effortless hierarchy without causing tension. Use one for headings and one for smaller copy.

## 3) Be mindful of tone

Itâ€™s not always enough to pair a serif and a sans-serif together. They have to accomplish the same goal. Avoid pairing a serious serif with a playful sans serif, or a decorative serif with a rigid sans serif. Ask yourself what personality each typeface conveys in the context of your work, and if that personality is in accord with your overall message.

## 4) Employ strategic sizing

When it comes to type, itâ€™s survival of the biggest and boldest. If your main point is the same size as the body text or is surrounded by other big and bold elements, viewers will probably move on before grasping it. In order to really pack a punch with your main point, make the difference between it and the surrounding copy drastic. Choose a font with weight to really give your key information priority.


## 5) Contrast colors

Color can be used to both classify information and add personality.

But the pop of color does more than tell your viewer where to look â€” it influences his or her emotional perception.Â Colors are attached to emotions, and are traditionally associated with different qualities. Implication is an aspect of visual hierarchy. By using hot pink, you are conveying a tone along with your message that your viewer may perceive as playful, sassy, sensual or intense.
## 6) Watch the whitespace

Another aspect of giving a message its due emphasis is using whitespaceÂ â€”Â the space between text. A design crammed with busy texyÂ is not likely to have a clear hierarchy, even if you follow the rest of these rules. Most people wonâ€™t even take the trouble to read it. You must give enough space to elements so that they are easier to parse individually and the overall design appears clean.

## Visual Hierarchy :

It is one of the core techniques in the design process as it is used for powerful UI Organization: Size, Proximity, contrast, Negative Space and other stuff to structure UI elements effectively. It organizes UI so that the brain could distinguish the objects on the basis of their physical appearance.

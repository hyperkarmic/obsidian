# customer  journey map

### A customer journey map is an excellent way to visualize how your users navigate your user experience. But what is a customer journey map, exactly? Let’s find out.
***

-   What problem drove the customer to your company?
-   How did they find your website or company?
-   Was the site or app easy to navigate?
-   What competitors did they research?
-   What differentiated your brand from the others? What made them decide to (or not to) choose your product?
-   What do they hope to achieve when interacting with your company?
-   How often do they interact with your brand or product and for how long each time?
-   Have they ever contacted support? What was the experience like?
-   What do they enjoy about your company? What do they find frustrating?
-   Are there areas they think could be improved? If so, what and how?

##### customer journey\
A customer journey is the experience an established or prospective customer has with your company when trying to accomplish a certain goal. The customer journey takes into account every point of contact a customer has with a business, not just their interaction with a single product. For instance, say someone wants to find a way to learn French language quickly. Their customer journey would include their realization of the problem or goal, researching about the different solutions available to them, deciding on a product, using it, and discontinuing its use.  While the product-level interaction is an important step, the customer journey takes into account how the product was marketed to the customer, customer service and support experiences, the purchasing experience, all the way to the discontinuation of use.

##### Customer journey map
Customers usually have a certain goal they would like to achieve when dealing with an organization or business. A journey map gives a visual depiction of the steps it takes for them to achieve that goal and how they felt about it along the way. Using journey maps allow businesses to take a walk in their customer’s shoes and accurately experience their brand as their users would. Often this helps identify gaps or pain points in the customers experience that the organization can then address and remedy.

The practice of moving through an experience as customers do helps businesses understand who their customers are and how they feel about their brand overall. These maps help create efficient work environments to create a brand that users feel happy to interact with as a whole.

Journey maps give you an idea of how users move through the user experience (in common use cases).

A [Customer Journey map](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/customer-journey-map?ep=uxmastery) is a visual or graphic interpretation of the overall **story** **from an individual’s perspective** of their relationship with an organization, service, product or brand, over time and across channels. Occasionally, a more narrative, text-based approach is needed to describe nuances and details associated with a customer experience.  The story is told from the customer’s perspective, but also emphasizes the important intersections between user expectations and business requirements.

# What Components Does a Journey Map Include?

### Must-haves

-   **Personas**: the main characters that illustrate the needs, goals, thoughts, feelings, opinions, expectations, and pain points of the user;
-   **Timeline**: a finite amount of time (e.g. 1 week or 1 year) or variable phases (e.g. awareness, decision-making, purchase, renewal);
-   **Emotion:** peaks and valleys illustrating frustration, anxiety, happiness etc.;
-   **Touchpoints**: customer actions and interactions with the organization. This is the WHAT the customer is doing; and
-   **Channels**: where interaction takes place and the [context of use](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/context-of-use?ep=uxmastery) (e.g. website, native app, call center, in-store). This is the WHERE they are interacting.

### Nice-to-haves

-   **Moments of truth**: A positive interaction that leaves a lasting impression, often planned for a touchpoint known to generate anxiety or frustration; and
-   **Supporting characters:** peripheral individuals (caregivers, friends, colleagues) who may contribute to the experience.

# The Process

### 1. Review Goals

Consider organizational goals for the product or service at large, and specific goals for a customer journey mapping initiative.

### 2. Gather Research

Review all relevant user research, which includes both qualitative and quantitative findings to provide [insights into the customer experience](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/customer-experience?ep=uxmastery). If more research is needed, get those research activities in the books. Some of my favorite research methods include customer interviews, ethnography & contextual inquiry, customer surveys, customer support/complaint logs, web analytics, social media listening, and competitive intelligence.

### 3. Touchpoint and Channel brainstorms

As a team, generate a list of the customer touchpoints and the channels on which those touchpoints occur today. Then brainstorm additional touchpoints and/or channels that can be incorporated in the future journeys you will be mapping. For example, the touchpoint could be “pay a bill”, and the channels associated with that touchpoint could be “pay online”, “pay via mail” or “pay in person”.

### 4. Empathy map

Empathy maps are a depiction of the various facets of a persona and his or her experiences in a given scenario. This exercise helps me organize my observations, build a deeper understanding of customers’ experiences, and draw out surprising insights into what customers need. Empathy maps also provide a foundation of material to fuel journey mapping. The goal is to get a well-rounded sense of how it feels to be that persona in this experience, specifically focusing on what they’re thinking, feeling, seeing, hearing, saying and doing.
### 5. Brainstorm with lenses

The goal of lensed brainstorming is to generate as many ideas as possible in a short period of time. To gain focus as I generate ideas I use “lenses”—words representing key concepts, brand attributes or mindsets that help us look at a problem or scenario in a different way. For this exercise I recommend that the team agree on 3-5 lens words (for example: accessible, social, comforting), then set the clock for 2 minutes per lens word. Each person individually writes down as many ideas as they can think of in that time. After 2 minutes switch to the next lens word until all lens words have been used as idea inspiration. This ensures that every voice on the team is heard and generates a huge inventory of ideas.

### 6. Affinity diagram

This is a method to visually organize ideas and find cohesion in the team’s concepts. Affinity diagramming helps us shift from casting a wide net in exploring many possibilities, to gaining focus on the right solutions for this audience. All team members should put their ideas generated in the lensed brainstorming activity up on the wall. Have someone sort the ideas into categories and label them. As a group, begin to consider where you might combine, refine, and remove ideas to form a cohesive vision of the future customer experience.

### 7. Sketch the journey

Drumroll, please. This is the part you’ve been waiting for! It’s now time to put together all the pieces: timeline, touchpoints, channels, emotional highs and lows, and all the wonderful new ideas the team generated for how to improve the future customer journey. Get creative with how you lay it out—it doesn’t have to be a standard left to right timeline. It could be circular or helical. It could be one large map or it could be an interactive, clickable piece with embedded video. There are no templates, and there are infinite possibilities.

### 8. Refine and digitize

Journeys don’t always become a sophisticated deliverable—sometimes they begin and end as sticky notes on a wall or sketches on a whiteboard. But most of the time, when you go through the activities to arrive at a solid customer journey map, you want to polish it, leverage it in your work and share it with colleagues across the organization. If visual design isn’t your strong suit, consider collaborating closely with a visual designer who can transform the journey map sketch into an impressive artefact.

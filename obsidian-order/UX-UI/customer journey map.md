### A customer journey map is an excellent way to visualize how your users navigate your user experience. But what is a customer journey map, exactly? Let’s find out.
***

-   What problem drove the customer to your company?
-   How did they find your website or company?
-   Was the site or app easy to navigate?
-   What competitors did they research?
-   What differentiated your brand from the others? What made them decide to (or not to) choose your product?
-   What do they hope to achieve when interacting with your company?
-   How often do they interact with your brand or product and for how long each time?
-   Have they ever contacted support? What was the experience like?
-   What do they enjoy about your company? What do they find frustrating?
-   Are there areas they think could be improved? If so, what and how?

##### customer journey\
A customer journey is the experience an established or prospective customer has with your company when trying to accomplish a certain goal. The customer journey takes into account every point of contact a customer has with a business, not just their interaction with a single product. For instance, say someone wants to find a way to learn French language quickly. Their customer journey would include their realization of the problem or goal, researching about the different solutions available to them, deciding on a product, using it, and discontinuing its use.  While the product-level interaction is an important step, the customer journey takes into account how the product was marketed to the customer, customer service and support experiences, the purchasing experience, all the way to the discontinuation of use.

##### Customer journey map
Customers usually have a certain goal they would like to achieve when dealing with an organization or business. A journey map gives a visual depiction of the steps it takes for them to achieve that goal and how they felt about it along the way. Using journey maps allow businesses to take a walk in their customer’s shoes and accurately experience their brand as their users would. Often this helps identify gaps or pain points in the customers experience that the organization can then address and remedy.

The practice of moving through an experience as customers do helps businesses understand who their customers are and how they feel about their brand overall. These maps help create efficient work environments to create a brand that users feel happy to interact with as a whole.

Journey maps give you an idea of how users move through the user experience (in common use cases).

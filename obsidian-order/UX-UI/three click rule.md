# Three Click Rule
## The three-click rule or three click rule is an unofficial web design rule concerning the design of website navigation. It suggests that a user of a website should be able to find any information with no more than three mouse clicks.
 **click is an interaction that results in the _highest cognitive load_, because the _click works only in a small surface area_.**

# Reduce the number of actions to accomplish a task

Day by day, the **attention span** of humans is reducing to the point that even a goldfish has more **attention span** than us. The _more actions_ a user has to perform to achieve his goal, the _less likely_ it is that he will follow through.

<hr>
###  _Frequent actions_ should be large buttons, placed in easily reachable zones.

### In case you absolutely have to use **clicks**, make sure you minimize the number of **clicks**.

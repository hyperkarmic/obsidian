# Von Restorff Effect
> “The Von Restorff effect, also known as The Isolation Effect, predicts that when multiple similar objects are present, the one that differs from the rest is most likely to be remembered.”

**The Isolation effect**, as the name suggests, **the most important information needs to be visually different**. The most distinctive object draws the attention of the user and is striking. It should be notably diverse from other objects in the series in terms of color, size, etc.
***
Principle that establishes that within a homogenous list, an item that is isolated and distinct will be better remembered than all the other items.

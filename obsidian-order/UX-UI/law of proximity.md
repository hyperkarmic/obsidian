# Law of Proximity
> “Objects that are near or proximate to each other, tend to be grouped together.”

This law describes how **the human eye builds up a connection between the objects that are grouped as visual elements**. Elements that are close to each other are perceived to be related when compared with elements that are separate from each other.

Just like any book or any written story, different subjects and ideas are **separated with the help of paragraphs**, stating the practical implementation of the law of proximity.

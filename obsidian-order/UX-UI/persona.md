#### Persona (Creation)

Personas are not the customers you want, but the customers you actually have or that are already out there. These personas are fictional but represent a selection of this real audience and their behaviors. We build [user personas](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/what-is-a-persona/) from qualitative and some quantitative user research as well as web analytics that we have already performed on an online platform.

Personas are effective if they:

-   Are truly representative of real people, their motivations, goals, and needs
-   Reveal universal features and functionality
-   Give us an accurate picture of what users’ expectations are
-   Show us how users will interact with a site
-   Represent a large portion of users of the site

[Peter Morville](http://semanticstudios.com/), known as the founding father of Information Architecture, gives this advice about persona creation:

> _“Portraits and profiles of user types (and their goals and behaviors) remind us all that “you are not the user” and serve as an invaluable compass for design and development.”_

 Personas give the design team a generalized representation of your users so they can have a clear picture of the people they are designing for, their goals, skills, attitudes, problems, lifestyle etc.
 ***
 A persona is a profile. A character sketch. An approximation of a segment of your product users or target market. If you think of them in terms of **archetypes**, personas require you to look at who your users actually are (or the kinds of users you would like to focus on) and create a set of archetypes for the broad profile any one of your users might fit at any given time.

**Personas generate empathy; and empathy is essential to the DNA of UX design.** Personas allow you to look at a personal representation of your users and come to a better understanding of what your real users’ needs and goals look like in real moments of their lives.

### User personas vs. buyer personas

**User personas** (also known as design personas) and **buyer personas** (also known as marketing personas) are widely discussed and easily confused. So we’ll break it down with a simple definition of each type and their primary similarities and differences.

**Buyer personas are based on market research and information about your existing customers for the primary purpose of differentiating marketing efforts by market segment.** The research and analysis that goes into shaping the details of a buyer persona are all geared toward understanding the role your product plays in buyers’ lives. The goal is to focus your messaging so that you are representing your product in an accurate and appealing fashion for your target market. Buyer personas can also help shape the broad direction of product development if they uncover any particular problems that the product could potentially solve for buyers.

**User personas are based on user research and are designed for the primary purpose of cultivating empathy to influence the design process.** The research and analysis that goes into these is similar to what goes into buyer personas in that you’ll examine your real or potential user base to understand who they are, how they accomplish specific tasks with your product, any situational factors that impact their experience, and how you might improve the products as a whole to make the entire experience as smooth, efficient, and delightful as possible.
***
The primary difference is that a buyer (marketing) persona is based on people who are **buying** the product and focuses primarily on improving the marketing efforts that reach these people; a user (design) persona is based on the people who are or will be actually **using**the product and focuses primarily on improving the design of the product itself.

### Persona spectrums: Design for inclusion

[Persona spectrums are receiving growing attention in the design industry](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/persona-spectrums/) as the field moves toward inclusion. **Persona spectrums take a “typical” user and create iterations of that same persona across a spectrum of ability, identity, background, or experience to factor a wider range of user needs into the design process.**

For example, you could set up one of your personas as having limited use of one arm either permanently (amputation or paralysis), temporarily (arm is in a cast), or situationally (they’re holding a cup of coffee or a child, etc.).

This approach is based on the idea that any one of your users might experience exclusion from your product at any given time for any number of reasons—why not design a solution to that problem? You’ll end up with more inclusive personas and products.

ccording to Margaret P, of Microsoft Design, [personas shift the focus from a “fake person”](https://medium.com/microsoft-design/kill-your-personas-1c332d4908cc) to the key motivation that drives people to use your product:

> _“A persona spectrum is not a fake person. It’s an articulation of a specific human motivation and the ways it’s shared across multiple groups. It shows how that motivation can change depending on context.”_

Persona spectrums are an integral part of Kat Holmes’ [Inclusive Design Toolkit](https://katholmesdesign.com/inclusive-toolkit) (developed for Microsoft). [Microsoft defines inclusive design](https://www.microsoft.com/design/inclusive/) as “a design methodology that enables and draws on the full range of human diversity.” Persona spectrums certainly contribute to this goal by creating variations of personas. These variations help reveal a wider variety of goals and pain points by examining how motivations change when a certain contextual element shifts—whether that change is permanent, temporary, or situational.

y. What if a user has, for example, limited use of one or both hands? This might be permanent due to any number of physical or medical factors; it might be temporary—maybe they’ve broken their arm or sprained a wrist; or it could be situational as a user might be carrying something in their arms or juggling household tasks. They could easily find themselves excluded from a full experience of our designs if we haven’t taken this limitation into consideration.

A persona spectrum takes these permanent, temporary, and situational factors into consideration and allows us to look for design solutions that solve real problems for these very specific users.

The solutions we discover will be helpful to users dealing with the permanent limitation (likely a relatively small percentage of our users), but those same solutions will help users who face that limitation on a temporary or situational basis—which could include **all** of our users at some point in time.

In [Sarah Dzida’s consideration of persona spectrums](https://www.uxbooth.com/articles/persona-spectrums-building-for-inclusion-and-accessibility/), she applies the concept to cognitive/intellectual ability by looking at a user with a reading disability (permanent), a user traveling in a foreign country and unable to read most of what’s around them (temporary), and a user who is reading complex tax documentation (situational).

What if we took race, gender identity, cultural background, or any other number of diversities into account? The result would be products that are more inclusive and, thus, more readily usable by more people.

# user persona

#### Persona (Creation)

Personas are not the customers you want, but the customers you actually have or that are already out there. These personas are fictional but represent a selection of this real audience and their behaviors. We build [user personas](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/what-is-a-persona/) from qualitative and some quantitative user research as well as web analytics that we have already performed on an online platform.

Personas are effective if they:

-   Are truly representative of real people, their motivations, goals, and needs
-   Reveal universal features and functionality
-   Give us an accurate picture of what users’ expectations are
-   Show us how users will interact with a site
-   Represent a large portion of users of the site

[Peter Morville](http://semanticstudios.com/), known as the founding father of Information Architecture, gives this advice about persona creation:

> _“Portraits and profiles of user types (and their goals and behaviors) remind us all that “you are not the user” and serve as an invaluable compass for design and development.”_

 Personas give the design team a generalized representation of your users so they can have a clear picture of the people they are designing for, their goals, skills, attitudes, problems, lifestyle etc.

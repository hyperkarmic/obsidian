## Fitts’ Law

In the 1950s, Paul Fitts demonstrated that the distance to, and size of a target, affect the error rate of selecting that target. In other words, it’s harder to tap a small button and exponentially harder to tap a small button that is further away.

UX designers commonly apply this law when considering mobile breakpoints due to the relatively small viewport. However, mobile viewports tend not to be large enough for any distance to affect tap accuracy.

> “The time to acquire a target is a function of distance to and size of the target.”

This law states that the time required for a user to move to its target area is a function of the distance between the pointer of the user divided by the size of the target area. It demonstrates how to **ease interactions through the careful sizing and positioning of interface elements**. Touch targets should be large enough to be recognized and accurately selected by users.

In [human-computer interaction](https://www.zorraquino.com/en/dictionary/digital-marketing/what-is-human-computer-interaction.html "Human-computer interaction"), Fitts’ Law makes it possible to calculate how long it takes a user to identify a target in accordance with the size and distance of the target. In web usability, for example, this affects the font size used for a link, the positioning of a button or a prompt for action, or the length of drop-down menus.

## Fitts’ Law

In the 1950s, Paul Fitts demonstrated that the distance to, and size of a target, affect the error rate of selecting that target. In other words, it’s harder to tap a small button and exponentially harder to tap a small button that is further away.

UX designers commonly apply this law when considering mobile breakpoints due to the relatively small viewport. However, mobile viewports tend not to be large enough for any distance to affect tap accuracy.

> “The time to acquire a target is a function of distance to and size of the target.”

This law states that the time required for a user to move to its target area is a function of the distance between the pointer of the user divided by the size of the target area. It demonstrates how to **ease interactions through the careful sizing and positioning of interface elements**. Touch targets should be large enough to be recognized and accurately selected by users.

In [human-computer interaction](https://www.zorraquino.com/en/dictionary/digital-marketing/what-is-human-computer-interaction.html "Human-computer interaction"), Fitts’ Law makes it possible to calculate how long it takes a user to identify a target in accordance with the size and distance of the target. In web usability, for example, this affects the font size used for a link, the positioning of a button or a prompt for action, or the length of drop-down menus.

Fitts’s Law establishes that **the further away a target is and the smaller the size of the target, the longer it takes for a user to acquire**.

Large targets that are close by have the lowest interaction cost, while small targets that far away have the highest interaction costs.

[The Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/interaction-cost-definition/) defines interaction costs as  “the sum of efforts—mental and physical—that the users must deploy in interacting with a site to reach their goals.” 

So, if a user can find an answer they’re looking for without needing to scroll, tap, or explore, they’re experiencing **zero interaction cost**. If a user has to locate a menu, scroll through over a dozen options, and click a small button to complete their form, that’s going to be a higher interaction cost. 

Ideally, UX and UI designers aim to make these costs as low as possible. The lower the interaction cost, the better the usability of their app.

Designers can minimize interaction costs by following Fitts’s Law and minimizing reading, scrolling, clicking, typing, waiting for pages to load, attention switches, memory load, and exploring to find relevant information.

Consider safety measures for heavy machinery: the shutdown button is almost always large, red, and easier to press than the startup button. Convenience in mobile apps would be those that make their login buttons fit within the thumb zones. 

Fitts’s Law is the reason buttons on websites are large, and menus are usually located in the upper corners of your screen.

UI designers can tell people what to do by placing significant calls to action close to related forms or headlines. This is where users expect to see them and can easily click them with low effort.

### What is the prime pixel?

The prime pixel is where a user’s cursor is located on the screen when they open a website or application. It’s the point where the user will carry out all of their tasks from.

This is why right-click menus exist—they’re naturally closest to the prime pixel.

On mobile devices, the prime pixel is the area where your thumbs naturally hover. They are also known as the **thumb zones**.
***
### What are magic pixels?

Magic pixels are the four corners of a screen, the top edge, and the bottom edge of a screen. The magic pixels create boundaries. Your cursor cannot move beyond these points. They are almost always the furthest away from the prime pixel. 

Designers use conventions like the center of the screen, the corners, and the thumb zones on mobile as guides for optimal placement because they can’t predict the prime pixel.

Having a standardized website that’s easy to navigate is just as important as proximity to CTAs, as you’ll learn by using tricks such as [the Rule of Thirds](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/what-is-the-rule-of-thirds/).

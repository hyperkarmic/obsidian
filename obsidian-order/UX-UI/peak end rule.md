## Peak-End Rule

The [Peak-End Rule](https://lawsofux.com/peak-end-rule/) states that users judge an experience based on how they felt at the peak and the end, rather than an average of the experience.

Designers commonly use the Peak-End Rule to focus design resources on the primary goal of each experience (e.g. adding an item to a cart) and the closing experience (e.g. paying for the item).

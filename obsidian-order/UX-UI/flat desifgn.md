# flat design
Flat design is a minimalist design style that is two dimensional. Inspired by Swiss style, it features contrasting color palettes, minimalist typography, white space, crisp edges, and grid-based layouts. 

Flat design is a streamlined and modern way to deliver information fast. It involves not shading, no added glare, and no highlights that are often used in other design styles to make images look three dimensional.

### Six characteristics of flat design

Flat design is a modern design style that consistently maintains minimalist, 2D features. Here are six signs that what you’re looking at is flat design.

1.  **Contrasting colors:** often bright colors, flat design relies on distinct contrast to send visual cues to users.
2.  **2D styling:** simple shapes and no realistic images.
3.  **Simple typography:** typically sans-serif fonts are the choice of flat design. It loads fast, it fits with minimalist style, and it’s easy to read. 
4.  **White space:** negative space helps designers indicate which part of the page they want users to focus on and makes the website more readable.
5.  **Grid-based layouts:** usually flat design is symmetrical and uses a grid for the layout and hierarchy.
6.  **Simplicity:** symbolic icons, abstract forms, no textures, and no gradients.

Flat design allows UI designers to think of their designs more as a functional tool rather than aesthetic. Since the success of their work is based on the value that the design brings to the user more than aesthetic appeal, many UI designers love flat design. 

Since flat design can be subtle, UI designers need to help users navigate their website without too much styling. They use negative space, contrasting colors, animations, and vector illustrations to show the user how to interact with their designs. The grid-based layout of flat design also helps UI designers efficiently lay out an intuitive interface. 

The simplicity of flat design also allows UI designers to deliver a clear message more easily. [Bold sans serif fonts](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ui-design/typography-trends/) and contrasting colors allow designers to communicate a strong message. Some projects will call for bright colors to set a mood, while others set the tone with simple neutrals that contrast well.

**Semi-flat design is essentially flat design, but with shadows and layering added back in.**

With semi-flat design, designers began indicating more direction for their users by adding shadows under buttons and using arrows and animations to indicate next steps. They also use highlights and layers to accentuate clickable elements further.

Flat design can be used to create icon sets, typography, apps, graphical user interfaces, websites, motion graphics, infographics, and games. If you want to create simple, efficient and on-trend designs, flat design is a great option.

As awesome as flat design can be, it has its drawbacks too. Nielsen Norman Group [analyzed flat design over its first three years of popularity](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/flat-design/ "analyzed flat design over its first three years of popularity."). They found that overexposure to flat design elements can reduce their user efficiency because they simplify things to the point that users don’t understand what’s clickable and what isn’t.

1.  Flat design is a minimal approach to UI, web, and app design that boasts speed, readability, scalability, and simplicity. 
2.  Avoid getting too minimal when using flat design. We’re now in the era of flat 2.0. Use shading, gradients, and animations to get your point across!

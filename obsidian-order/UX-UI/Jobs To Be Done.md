## What is Jobs-To-Be-Done?

Jobs-To-Be-Done (JTBD) shifts the focus from a hypothetical or aggregate user to what your actual users want to accomplish by using your product.

This approach sets the starting point for your design process at the job your users want your product to accomplish. Rather than creating a representation of your users, you ask what job your customers are “hiring” your product to accomplish. A JTBD approach starts by asking, “What do our users _really_ want?”

Unlike user personas, JTBD doesn’t have a defined process or specific artifacts that will uniformly result from its implementation. Depending on which [two interpretations of JTBD](https://jtbd.info/know-the-two-very-different-interpretations-of-jobs-to-be-done-5a18b748bd89) you adhere to, the application, process, and resulting artifacts will look different.

Alan Klement, discussing the [mistakes you can make when learning JTBD](https://jtbd.info/5-mistakes-to-avoid-when-first-learning-jobs-to-be-done-80594015f643), emphasizes that JTBD is not a set framework or method: “JTBD is not the study of how people use products, it’s the study of _why_.”

Where user personas are themselves _artifacts_ (things you could, for instance, put in your portfolio) that result from a process, JTBD is a theoretical approach that helps you to think differently about your product and what it needs to do.

What does JTBD look like in practical terms? The classic example of JTBD looks at a drill. A person goes out and buys a drill. What job is it that they’re hiring that drill to accomplish? They probably don’t just want a drill for the sake of having one (unless they’re a drill collector/connoisseur—is that a thing?). What do they _really_ want? They want for there to be a specific-sized hole in a particular part of their wall, table, or other surface. That is the job to be done.

### Approach: Jobs-to-Be-Done

Taking a truly Jobs-To-Be-Done approach would start before you even decided on a meal planning app. It would begin with the users you want to help. You’d do field studies and interviews and anything else that helps put your hand on the pulse of what your target audience needs. As you do this, you begin to realize that there are a lot of people who express frustration about their eating habits or how much they spend on groceries. You post the question, “How might we help people eat in healthier ways and be smarter in their spending on food?” And eventually you’d reach the idea of a meal planning app.

Maybe you had the meal planning app idea and then backed out of it to make sure you were on track by asking a quintessential JTBD question: What do our users **really** want?

They probably don’t want just another app on their phone. They want one with this specific function. **But why?** Do they want to make grocery lists? Maybe. **But why?** Do they want to try new recipes? Perhaps. **But why?**

Ultimately, they don’t even want a meal planning app. What they **really** want is to get better at meal planning—and even this has underlying motivations that are dependent on particular users (ie, to be healthier, to save money, etc.). Knowing this, you can step back and wonder about the ways in which your meal planning app can help create better meal planners!

**Pros:** 

-   Reduces bias or echo chamber effects by moving away from who users are, or where they live, or who they do life with and toward what they want to get done
-   Useful at the very beginning of the process, when decisions are being made that determine the overall direction and purpose of the app
-   Ensures that users will accomplish their goal with your app
-   Can generate more inclusive solutions, as long as inherently exclusive assumptions are not made about what users want

**Cons:**

-   Removes the explicitly humanizing elements (particularly the visual ones)
-   Still susceptible to assumption
-   Less useful throughout the lifespan of the product as it’s not the most useful approach to revealing pain points or determining smaller features and interactions

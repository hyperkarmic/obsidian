# UX Questions
#### Key questions UX designers ask themselves

No matter what product or service they are designing, or what stage of the process they are at, UX designers will ask themselves the following questions:

-   Is the product usable? Is it logical, self-explanatory and easy to use?
-   Does the product or service solve an existing user problem?
-   Is it accessible for different categories of users? You can read more about accessibility in design below.
-   Is the product or service desirable? Does it create a positive experience which the user would be happy to repeat?

From a user perspective, good UX design ultimately enables us to go about our daily lives as effortlessly as possible. From setting an alarm to chatting with friends online, listening to music or using a calendar app, the ease with which we complete these actions is the result of good design.

When designing these experiences, UX designers must consider how they can bring value to all kinds of users. They do this by practicing inclusive designâ€”otherwise known as universal or accessible design.

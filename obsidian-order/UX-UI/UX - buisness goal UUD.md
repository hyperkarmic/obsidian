UX - buisness goal UUD
 
 business goal needs to be making that purchase a **useful, usable and delightful** action.

**Useful:** You need to solve a user’s need; a problem that users actually have.

**Usable:** Usability needs to be clear so that users understand your product/service.

**Delightful:** It’s no bad thing if a user enjoys using your product.

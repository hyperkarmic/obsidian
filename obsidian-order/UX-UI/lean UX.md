# lean UX
minimizes waste and maximizing value. Some core tenets of lean UX are:

-   Cross-functional collaboration between designers, engineers, and product managers.
-   Gathering feedback quickly and continuously, ensuring that you’re constantly learning and adapting as you go.
-   Deciding as late as possible and delivering fast, with less focus on long-term deliverables.
-   A strong emphasis on how the team operates as a whole.

As [Jonny Schneider, Product Strategy and Design Principal at ThoughtWorks](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/2017/09/understanding-design-thinking-lean-agile-work-together/), explains: “Design Thinking is how we explore and solve problems; Lean is our framework for testing our beliefs and learning our way to the right outcomes; Agile is how we adapt to changing conditions with software.”
***
 Design Thinking is a solution-based approach to exploring and solving problems. It focuses on generating ideas with a specific problem in mind, keeping the user at the heart of the process throughout. Once you’ve established and designed a suitable solution, you’ll start to incorporate **lean principles**—testing your ideas, gathering quick and ongoing feedback to see what works—with particular emphasis on cross-team collaboration and overcoming departmental silos.

 , Lean UX is a design strategy focused around minimizing wasted time and effort during the design process. While that might sound simple enough, Lean UX has recently taken the design world by storm, with many proclaiming that it’s the epitome of design method evolution.
 ***
 This is what Lean UX aims to change.

Based on the popular Agile Design Method wherein the design phases run parallel alongside each other rather than following each other linearly, Lean UX is a collaborative, user-centric approach to design that focuses on minimizing wasted time, money and resources during the design cycle. The Lean UX approach asserts that a product’s initial prototype will always be wrong and need improvement, so it encourages the creation of a minimal viable product — a product with the bare essentials needed to conduct user testing.
***
There are three fundamental phases of Lean UX:

-   Build: create a low-fidelity prototype that outlines the backbones and bare essentials of the product design
-   Measure: conduct a round of user testing based on your prototype, and use your hypothesis to test your assumptions
-   Learn: analyze and deconstruct the feedback gathered before making the necessary improvements and taking the design to the next stage

Lean UX has 5 core principles:

#### Act as one team

The first key principle of Lean UX is acting as one team. This means going against the tradition of delegating tasks based on skill and keeping design teams separate, instead bringing together designers, product designers, engineers, and developers to work together. Having a diverse team with a multitude of backgrounds and disciplines in the mix means you’ll come up with more diverse and well-rounded solutions to the problems brought up by the user testing. It also helps to foster a shared understanding of the consumer and the issues facing you in the design process. As you can imagine, this is often easier said than done — but it’s well worth the initial getting used to.

#### Solve the right problem

The second core principle of Lean UX is solving the right problems over the wrong ones. Lean UX relies heavily on a loop of continuous learning facilitated by continuous feedback. By receiving this feedback, the team will be able to hone in and focus on solving the right problem with a deeper understanding of the issue at hand. By working in small increments, i.e. a weekly feedback session that informs a week of work, you’ll be able to focus on finding a solution without any large risk. If your solution isn’t working and you need to reframe the problem, this way you will have only wasted a week — rather than, say, 3 or 4 months.

#### Design collaboratively

The third and perhaps most important principle of Lean UX is collaboration. In the design world, there’s a growing step towards ‘many hats’ job specs and away from limiting yourself with [specific and specialized design roles](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/ux-designer-job-descriptions-guide/). This increasing demand for designers who can work across disciplines is paving the way towards a collaborative future — a future where Lean UX will thrive. One way to facilitate collaboration between teams is to have a shared whiteboard or painted white wall that allows anyone to add their ideas and thoughts to.

#### Be flexible

The penultimate core principle of Lean UX is flexibility. In traditional UX, you’re always working with a high level of uncertainty — but the traditional approach is to try and change that. This is a different story in Lean UX, where you should always assume (no matter how well it’s going) that the plan is going to change — and therefore you need to plan accordingly. For example, your second round of user testing might mean that your initial assumptions are proved wrong, and you have to go back to square one. This might go against some people’s instinct, and many may instead be tempted to make some minor changes and continue on as normal. But being flexible is critical to the Lean UX process.

#### De-emphasize deliverables

The fifth and final core principle of Lean UX is a de-emphasis on designing for deliverables. Where traditional design favors upfront work, Lean UX focuses on adjusting your design process as you go along in order to become more agile compatible. That’s not to say that Lean UX is devoid of deliverables; rather, it asserts that you should work out what conversation needs to be had in order to move forward to the next step. In short, Lean UX places emphasis on conversations rather than deliverables in the design process.

Based on these 5 principles, you may have noticed that Lean UX actually overlaps with the [design thinking process](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/what-is-design-thinking-everything-you-need-to-know-to-get-started/) in a number of ways. The collaborative brainstorming approach to finding solutions (and then testing those solutions) is also a key part of the design thinking process, as is the attention to the customer. Also, [building empathy](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/what-is-empathy-in-design-thinking/) is integral to Lean UX and is an essential part of the design thinking process. Lastly, paying close attention to the needs of the customer is a textbook design thinking component. It can even be said that Lean UX draws inspiration from the design process in a multitude of ways!
***
Where traditional UX places focus on detailed deliverables based on the user testing that was conducted at the start of the project, Lean UX focuses more on improving the product as you go along to ensure that the final outcome is the best that it can be. In Lean UX, you’re constantly asking what changes and improvements can be made in the here and now rather than waiting until you’ve got a finished product and then making necessary tweaks or improvements.
***
Finally, while traditional UX and Lean UX use largely the same principles when it comes to user testing, Lean UX tends to be a lot less meticulous and, in turn, a lot faster. Where traditional UX would spend months analyzing the feedback in extreme detail, Lean UX tends to cancel out the noise and look purely at the raw data in order to decipher what immediate changes need to be made. To boil it down, many think of Lean UX as being learning-oriented while thinking of traditional UX as being results-oriented.
***
Design thinking has an amalgamation of approaches, which makes it unique — they may be why — design thinking is applied as an umbrella term for multi-disciplinary, human-centered projects that involve research and rapid ideation (idea generation). Most recently as an approach, it has begun to monitor and measure itself in a quantified way.

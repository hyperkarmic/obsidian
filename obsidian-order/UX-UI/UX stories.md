# UX Stories

-   Using stories can bring teams together by helping them better understand the reasons behind the decisions to include specific features and interactions and creating a shared language for discussing those features and interactions.
-   Stories can be used to keep a project user-centric. Personas should be used to create characters with names who are referred to throughout the project and user interactions can be seen as the plot of the story those characters are the protagonists in.
-   Stories should be a key part of presentations to stakeholders and clients. Tips for using them include: Speaking your clients and stakeholders’ language, center your presentation on clients’ and stakeholders’ concerns, tell the stories of real users and use visuals to support the story you’re telling.

#### Information Architecture

> _“It is important to get people you work with to make important decisions on language and structure. When people in your organization are using different words to describe the same thing, beware. Unresolved semantic and taxonomic arguments often result in unneeded increases in scope and complexity.”_ —Abby Covert, President at IA institute and author of How to Make Sense of Any Mess

A user who is overwhelmed by too much information or gets ‘lost’ navigating through a site is going to have a **bad experience of that product, brand, or service**. To avoid these scenarios, a process called **Information Architecture** is carried out by the UX team as part of the UX design process.
***
The purpose of Information Architecture (IA) is to **structure, label, and organize the content** on a site so that users can find exactly what they need to perform the task they want and to reach their goal. Through the information architecture, a UX designer finds out not only how each piece of the site fits together, but also how each item relates to all the other items within this structure.
***
This process helps the user understand **what to expect** when they navigate the site, as items that they logically (and from experience) expect to come together can and will.
***
Benefits of Information Architecture:

-   Increased customer self-sufficiency and therefore more satisfied customers
-   Effective page navigation
-   Reduced support costs
-   Decreased drop-off rates
***
e **hierarchy of the content** on your site can be done in multiple ways. This leads us to another important UX method: **Card Sorting**. In a [card sorting session](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/what-is-card-sorting/), users organize topics from content within your website into groups that make sense to them. They then need to label each group in a way they feel accurately describes the content. This can be done using actual cards, pieces of paper, or one of several online card sorting software tools.
***
Next, you’ll start thinking about the kind of content needed and how it will be structured across the website or app. This is what’s known as [information architecture](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/a-beginners-guide-to-information-architecture/); working out the most logical layout and organization of the content.

Good information architecture makes sure that the user can easily find what they’re looking for and intuitively navigate from one page to the next without too much thought.

##### 8 principles of information archetecture

1.  **The principle of objects:** Content should be treated as a living, breathing thing. It has lifecycles, behaviors, and attributes.
2.  **The principle of choices:** Less is more. Keep the number of choices to a minimum.
3.  **The principle of disclosure:**Show a preview of information that will help users understand what kind of information is hidden if they dig deeper.
4.  **The principle of exemplars:** Show examples of content when describing the content of the categories.
5.  **The principle of front doors:** Assume that at least 50% of users will use a different entry point than the home page.
6.  **The principle of multiple classifications:** Offer users several different classification schemes to browse the site’s content.
7.  **The principle of focused navigation:** Keep navigation simple and never mix different things.
8.  **The principle of growth:** Assume that the content on the website will grow. Make sure the website is scalable.

### The value for the user

We live in a world where people want instant gratification. This, combined with an overload of information and choice means you really have to deliver the right content at the right time. If the process of finding information is too complicated or too slow, the user will simply abandon the process and move on.
***
##### Needs In IA
-   **Known-item seeking**: Users will come to the website to search for something desirable and known.
-   **Exploratory seeking**: Users will come to the website looking for inspiration. They’re looking for something desirable but not sure what exactly.
-   **Exhaustive research**: Users are in a process of an extensive research. They want to find as much information as possible.
-   **Re-finding:**A user needs a desired items again and are trying to find it.
***
### The value for the business

If users and customers cannot find critical information or perform the most important tasks, businesses can lose out in many ways. IA can play a crucial role in the following.

Information architecture is to a website, library or shop, what the concrete foundations are to a house. **To create the best possible foundations, we need to create an IA document.**
***
#### Step 1: Group and label the content

Once you have a list of all content, prioritize it and group. Use card-sorting techniques to help you group the content.

Card sorting is a participatory design technique, which we use to determine how users group different items into different categories. They are given cards with printed terms, features, or concepts and are asked to sort them into groups.

In the end group names can be refined into a menu and sitemap.

#### Step 2: Define navigation and create site map

You have content, and you have groups that make sense. Now the big question – how will users get to this content?

Before you can create sitemap and navigation, your IA needs to be defined. The navigation is most of the times just the tip of the iceberg.

Information architecture isn’t really visible to the visitors, but it presents a backbone of the website, and can be visually presented in spreadsheets and different types of diagrams and is then called a sitemap.

To create a sitemap, you need to have content, which is grouped and labeled, and then presented in a diagram.

Once that is done, you can create navigation – collection of UI elements that are connected in a meaningful way. Those can be anything from global navigation – menu, to local navigation, breadcrumbs, filters, footer…

#### Step 3: User testing

Test early and test often.

There are a couple of ways how to test to see if the information architecture works. The Nielsen Norman Group suggest four different types of testing, depending on the design phase and goals:
***
#### 4 types of IA tests
**Test #1: Tree testing**

This test is used to determine if the key information can be found in the IA of the website. Participants navigate through the website only by using link names. Tree testing is a quantitative testing method.

Tree testing shows us if the names of the categories are understandable, if they convey the content correctly, if the content is categorized in a user-centered manner, if the titles are distinguishable from one another, and if the information is easy to find.

**Test #2: Closed card sorting**

The test is used to determine the strength of category names. It is both a quantitative and qualitative testing method.

It shows if the names of categories are accurately conveyed and if they accurately convey the content. It also shows us if the categorization is done in a user-centered manner, and if the titles are distinguishable from one another.

**Test #3: Click testing**

The test shows us how users use the available UI components. It is a quantitative testing method.

It shows us which navigation elements are used and which are overlooked or avoided.

**Test #4: Usability testing**

The test is used to determine how and why users use a website (or a product). It is one of the qualitative testing techniques.

It reveals how users find information, which ways do they use and which do they ignore or just plainly refuse to use and why.

If you cannot do all 4, make sure you at least do the usability testing in combination with an interview at the end. That will give you valuable insight into what features people are using and what they do on your website and why.
***
Good information architecture will ensure that your users are self-sufficient (fewer messages to your customer service asking how to do something painfully simple), lower levels of user frustration (and ultimately more satisfaction and trust), and therefore lower drop-off or drop-out rates. Which probably means more revenue, and probably means happy managers_—_and a job well done.

## Information Architecture :

It is a science of organizing and structuring the content of the websites, web and mobile application and social media software so that users would easily adjust to the functionality of the product and could find everything they need, without big efforts.

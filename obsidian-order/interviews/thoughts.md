# interview thoughts
In today’s world, it is rare that people aren’t multi-tasking, on their phone, getting their coffee, or whatever. They are distracted. It is only in an interview have I seen managers/CEOs put their phone away and really listen to me. Their reason is often selfish for them, but the attention is still the same.

The person you are interviewing may cross your path in years to come and it is important to learn about them as much as they are learning about you.

# memory creation phase
What happens in the memory creation phase is, javascript will allocate memory for all variables and functions. As soon as javascript encounters some code it will allocate memory for the variable. In our case, the variable is x, which gets its memory allocated. The same thing goes for function declaration as well. At this memory creation phase, javascript automatically stores the value of a variable as “undefined” in the memory, and in the case of a function, it stores the whole function in the memory.

# (code) execution phase
**Execution phase** — This is the phase where the code is executed. JS engine will run through the code, perform the specified calculations, and update the variables in the variable environment.
***
If we have initialized our variable with some value, then that value is stored only in the second phase i.e. Code Execution phase. This justifies why we are able to access a variable even before initializing it and the program not displaying any error while its execution.

## worker environment

In some JavaScript environments, such as web workers and service workers, you will also have a worker environment, which allows you to run JavaScript code in a separate thread from the main JavaScript execution thread. This can help improve performance by allowing background tasks to run concurrently with the main JavaScript execution thread.

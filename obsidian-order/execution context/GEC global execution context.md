## Global environment

Another environment that exists in JavaScript is the global environment. The global environment is created when the JavaScript interpreter starts, and it provides the context for any code that is not inside a function. In web browsers, the global environment is represented by the window object and in Node.js it is represented by the global object. Every variable and function defined in the global scope is a property of the global object.

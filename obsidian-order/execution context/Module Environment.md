## module environment

Another environment that can exist in JavaScript is the module environment. JavaScript modules are a way to include and reuse code in JavaScript applications. Each module has its own scope, and variables, functions, and classes defined within a module are not visible outside of the module by default. To share code between modules, JavaScript provides a mechanism called “export” which allows a module to make some of its variables, functions, and classes available to other modules. A module can also import variables, functions, and classes from other modules using the “import” statement.

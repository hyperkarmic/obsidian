Throttling is a technique often used in JavaScript to limit the rate at which a function can be called. This can be useful in a variety of situations, such as when dealing with events that may be triggered many times in a short period of time, or when making requests to a server that should not be sent too frequently
***
For example, consider a web page that includes a button that, when clicked, makes an AJAX request to the server to fetch some data. If the user clicks the button repeatedly in quick succession, multiple requests will be made to the server, which could potentially cause performance issues. To prevent this, we can use throttling to limit the number of times the button click event is allowed to be triggered within a certain time frame.

There are several ways to implement throttling in JavaScript. One common approach is to use a timer function such as setTimeout or setInterval to wrap the function being throttled. The timer function can be used to enforce a delay between calls to the throttled function, allowing it to be called only once within the specified time period.

Throttling is a useful tool for optimizing the performance of web applications and providing a better user experience. However, it is important to use it carefully, as overuse or improper implementation can lead to unintended consequences and degrade performance.

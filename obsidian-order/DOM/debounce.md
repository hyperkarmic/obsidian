# debounce
**ebouncing:** **Debouncing** is a programming pattern or a technique to restrict the calling of a time-consuming function frequently, by delaying the execution of the function until a specified time to avoid unnecessary CPU cycles, and API calls and improve performance. A Debounce function is a **higher-order function** that returns another function, to create closure around the function parameters (func, timeout) and the timer variable.

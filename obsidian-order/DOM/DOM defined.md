  ## What is the Document Object Model (DOM)?

The DOM is a web interface, developed and released by the **World Wide Web Consortium ([W3C](https://www.w3.org/))**. This organization was founded to establish standards for the World Wide Web.

The DOM is a web API that is language-neutral. This means that you can implement and adopt it in any programming language.

The DOM represents the structural pieces of a web document as objects that can be accessed and manipulated. In other words, the DOM allows you as a software developer to do the following:  

-   Create and build web documents.  
-   Navigate the structure of web documents.  
-   Add, modify, or delete elements and content within web documents.

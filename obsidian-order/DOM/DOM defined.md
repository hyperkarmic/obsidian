# Dom Definition

DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface that allows us to create, change, or remove elements from the document. We can also add events to these elements to make our page more dynamic.
<hr>
Dom: The DOM views an HTML document as a tree of nodes. A node represents an HTML element.

  DOM: DOM stands for Document Object Model and represents all that series of objects that define the structure and content of a web page. In practice, we can say that the DOM represents the web page, which can then be modified using scripting languages ​​(such as JavaScript).

  ## What is the Document Object Model (DOM)?

The DOM is a web interface, developed and released by the **World Wide Web Consortium ([W3C](https://www.w3.org/))**. This organization was founded to establish standards for the World Wide Web.

The DOM is a web API that is language-neutral. This means that you can implement and adopt it in any programming language.

The DOM represents the structural pieces of a web document as objects that can be accessed and manipulated. In other words, the DOM allows you as a software developer to do the following:  

-   Create and build web documents.  
-   Navigate the structure of web documents.  
-   Add, modify, or delete elements and content within web documents.

  Whenever a web document — such as HTML — is loaded in the browser, an object-based representation of the document’s elements is created in a tree-like structure. This object representation is called the Document Object Model, also known as the DOM.

Due to its object-based nature, JavaScript and other scripting languages understand the DOM and can interact and manipulate the document content. For instance, with the DOM, developers can add or remove elements, modify their appearance and perform user’s actions on the web elements.

DOM operations like DOM querying and updating are lighter and thus are very fast. However, for the update to reflect on the web page, the page will have to re-render.
***
Following are some uses of JS DOM Methods:

1.  Add event listeners to listen for clicks, scrolls on different objects in DOM.
2.  Add, modify, delete different objects.
3.  Make web page interactive.
4.  JS DOM fundamentals hold great importance in learning JavaScript frameworks (React/ Angular/ Vue etc.)
5.  Add and remove classes from objects triggering animations. You can check an example![[dom2.jpg]] of animation using DOM [here](https://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_dom_animate_3).

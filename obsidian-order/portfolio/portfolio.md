# portfolio
***
With a well-built dev portfolio, you will be able to showcase your technical and soft skills. Your portfolio is the place to tell a story about yourself and, most importantly, to show employers your willingness to grow, even if you never worked professionally.
***
HR managers or developers will have clear in mind that you have no real work experience when applying to them, so when they visit your portfolio what they want to see is your **initiative to solve problems**, **your passion**, **your willingness to learn**.
***
 **The exact projects you decide to build doesn’t matter that much — as long as the choices behind them are correct.**
 ***
 What’s the actual point behind your portfolio? Do you want to showcase your power in Angular? Demonstrate how good you can switch technologies? This varies from person to person. I’m more for a specialized developer. Pick three or four skills and do the best you can to build projects with them.
 ***
  **What I think will make your projects stand out is the meaning you give them.** You should _care_ about why you are building those projects — what you’re trying to demonstrate with them. These inner reasons will make your portfolio shine.
  ***
  -   **About:** Use a good description for yourself. Don’t use crazy words like: an _amazing developer_, _truly hard-working_, _incredibly passionate_. Focus on how you can help companies and clients in achieving goals. Something like: “Hi, I’m x, I use my skills to help companies create quality (insert here)”. See the great examples below, and please, remember to use a professional-quality image of yourself!
***
-   **Projects**: Your projects should go here. Write a short description of each one — the reason you built it and the clients that will use it. Possibly include the technologies stack used and a link to the source code.
***
-   **Contacts**: Your contact information. Just make sure it’s correct and always up-to-date.

# Key Takeaways

-   The competition to get a dev job is incredibly high, especially among junior developers. If you want to stand out then you need a great-looking portfolio.
-   Your first focus should be on making your portfolio look beautiful by taking inspiration from existing free designs.
-   A great portfolio is then composed of three main sections: _about me_, _projects_ and a _contact me_ form.
-   Don’t be boring in your about me section, remember to make your willingness to learn, skills, and passion shine in your words.
-   Have two to five amazing projects, or even one if that’s really great, and create a backstory for each one of them about why and how you implemented them.
-   In the end, create an efficient _contact me_ form to let employers find you easily.

A developer portfolio is a website that showcases your best work, personality and talents. It is your best chance to prove your skills, share your enthusiasm about the profession and give your potential employers and clients a glimpse of how awesome it would be to work with you.
***
Essential questions to ask yourself before building a portfolio:

-   **Who is your target audience?** Do you create a portfolio as an extension of your CV or as an independent website where you market your skills, sell your services and attract clients? These are two completely different use cases meaning different approaches to building a portfolio.
-   **What are they looking for?** For example, there’s a high chance that employers will want to have a look at your code while your clients won’t care about it – now you can deduce the website structure and content with more ease.
-   **How will they use your portfolio website?** Employers will most likely be interested to see your projects and code, while clients may take more interest in your professional services, case studies and personality.
-   **What are their pain points?** For example, employers need to make sure that you are a team player who meets deadlines and delivers quality – include quotes from your recommendation letters to solve these doubts. Or use client logos and case studies to prove to your potential clients that you are trustworthy and reliable.
-   **Why you?** Why should they choose you and not another developer or a whole agency instead? How are you different from others? What are the benefits of working with you?

***
The main goal of a developer portfolio is to impress its visitors with your projects, code, personality, UX and UI sensibilities. Therefore, a junior developer portfolio should contain a **smooth and straightforward user interface** with simple navigation.
***
Your portfolio homepage is your only chance to make a positive first impression. It needs to **make clear who you are and what you do**, contain your photo or image and have a hint of your personality in the intro text.
***
### Make Your Portfolio Scannable

The spread of the Internet has changed the way we [interact with web pages](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/text-scanning-patterns-eyetracking/): we no longer read them from top-to-bottom but scan. So make sure that your layout is perfectly styled, your texts are written in [plain language](https://www.iabcwaterloo.com/blog/2020/1/26/the-importance-of-plain-language) and are proofread, all links and interactable objects are up and running.

### Minimize Clicks

Portfolios don’t have to be complex – they should contain the most critical information for your visitors. Your projects, code samples, social media and contact form should be only a few clicks away.
***
As a developer, you should be aware of the UX and UI fundamentals. Your portfolio website should have a simple good looking UI and provide a good UX as well.
***
Website performance is another key element of a successful developer portfolio. Users are unlikely to wait for more than 3 seconds for your website to load. So, optimize the size of the images, [set up lazy-loading](https://web.dev/lazy-loading-images/), minimize the number of JavaScript and CSS files and use website caching.
***
### Remember Accessibility
***
## Showcase Your Best Work and Skills
Pick projects that you built yourself or, in the case of junior developers, don’t include projects from tutorials unless you customized and made them unique. Another good practice is to **supply projects with descriptions and the tech stack used**.
***
## Show Your Personality

A portfolio not only gives you a perfect opportunity to showcase your work and achievements but it is also a great means to express yourself. Your potential employers and clients want to know you better to understand if you are going to click.

Don’t hesitate to use the About Me part and **tell about your passion** for video games, pixel art or whatever drives you. Mention your background and education if you think they will communicate important details about you. **Add a hint of your personality** in the body of your website, its design and navigation – it’s your portfolio, after all. And, of course, don’t forget to **upload a headshot** or an image of yourself.
***
### Use Custom Domain

Your developer portfolio is a part of your brand as is your website address. To look professional, you need a suitable URL. Usually, a portfolio address includes the name of its owner or the work they do. Instead of hosting your website on a long-tailed subdomain, consider buying your own.
***
Many developers forget to **buy an SSL certificate** for their website that moves it from HTTP to HTTPS, making it more secure and trustworthy for browsers and search engines
***
### Make Use of Introductory Statement

One more place to express your personality is the intro paragraph on your homepage, where you may introduce yourself. Some developers use it to list their tech stack, while others include other relevant experience and related professions.
***
### Share Your Motivation (Optional)

This advice will bring the most benefit to bootcamp graduates and junior developers. To increase your chances of getting a job, you can **prove your motivation and passion for the profession** in your portfolio. Showcasing personal projects is one of the most solid ways to prove yourself reliable and motivated. **A few lines describing your inner motivation** is also an excellent way to highlight your ready-for-hard-work mindset.

Here are a few ideas of what to include in the portfolio:

-   Mention your achievements and career plans for the next few years
-   Share your career goals (technology to learn, projects to build) and highlight your passion for studying (attended industry events and conferences)
-   What you did, do and going to do to meet your career goals

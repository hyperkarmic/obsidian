# The C4 model

The C4 model is an architectural documentation standard for software systems that breaks a **software system** down into four levels:

-   **Context (level 1)**: Context diagrams are high-level, conceptual descriptions of what your system does, what problem it solves, the people involved, and any external systems that interact with it. These diagrams help provide a big picture overview.
-   **Containers (level 2)**: Container diagrams go one level deeper to describe high-level interactions between the applications or services that make up your system. Containers can represent APIs, databases, file systems, [microservices](https://www.educative.io/blog/microservices-architecture-tutorial-all-you-need-to-get-started?eid=5082902844932096), etc.
-   **Components (level 3)**: Component diagrams look at the different code bodies within a container. These diagrams help visualize abstractions of your codebase.
-   **Code (level 4)**: As the name suggests, code diagrams look at architectural elements mapped to code, like classes, interfaces, objects, and functions.

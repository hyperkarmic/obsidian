# single responsibility principle
## The Practical Definition:

The most applicable definition of SRP would be:

> A class should have one, and only one, reason to change. â€” Robert C. Martin

This definition advocates for each class to perform only one duty. It does not imply that a class should only have one method or property; rather, these methods/properties should be closely related to the responsibility of a class. A class with numerous objectives should be split into multiple classes.

# OOP - definition
OOP:(classic def)_Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of “objects”, which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures. A feature of objects is that an object’s own procedures can access and often modify the data fields of itself._

_OOP:__In Object-oriented Programming we combine a group of related variables into a unit. that unit is called an object. We refer to these variables as properties and the functions as methods._

Great developers have the _everything is an object_ mindset. They don’t just write object-oriented programming. They write good object-oriented programming.

[Object-oriented programming](https://www.educative.io/blog/object-oriented-programming) is a **style of programming**, not a tool, which is why even though it’s an older style, it’s still very popular and widely used. This style involves breaking a program into segments of objects that can communicate with each other.

Each object is defined by its own set of properties, which can then be accessed and modified through various operations.

“OOP is the ability, offered by the Polymorphism, to acquire absolute control of every dependency present in the source code of the system.”

“Software is not a rapidly advancing technology. The rules of software are the same today as they were in 1946, when Alan Turing wrote the very first code that would execute in an electronic computer. The tools have changed, and the hardware has changed, but the essence of software remains the same.  
Software — the stuff of computer programs — is composed of sequence, selection, iteration, and indirection. Nothing more. Nothing less.” - Uncle Bob Martin

“Indeed, the ratio of time spent reading versus writing is well over 10 to 1. We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code. ...[Therefore,] making it easy to read makes it easier to write.” ([ref.](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/835238-indeed-the-ratio-of-time-spent-reading-versus-writing-is))

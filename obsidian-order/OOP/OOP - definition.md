(aka Procedural Programming`)
OOP:(classic def)_Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of “objects”, which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures. A feature of objects is that an object’s own procedures can access and often modify the data fields of itself._

_OOP:__In Object-oriented Programming we combine a group of related variables into a unit. that unit is called an object. We refer to these variables as properties and the functions as methods._

Great developers have the _everything is an object_ mindset. They don’t just write object-oriented programming. They write good object-oriented programming.

[Object-oriented programming](https://www.educative.io/blog/object-oriented-programming) is a **style of programming**, not a tool, which is why even though it’s an older style, it’s still very popular and widely used. This style involves breaking a program into segments of objects that can communicate with each other.

Each object is defined by its own set of properties, which can then be accessed and modified through various operations.

“OOP is the ability, offered by the Polymorphism, to acquire absolute control of every dependency present in the source code of the system.”

“Software is not a rapidly advancing technology. The rules of software are the same today as they were in 1946, when Alan Turing wrote the very first code that would execute in an electronic computer. The tools have changed, and the hardware has changed, but the essence of software remains the same.  
Software — the stuff of computer programs — is composed of sequence, selection, iteration, and indirection. Nothing more. Nothing less.” - Uncle Bob Martin

“Indeed, the ratio of time spent reading versus writing is well over 10 to 1. We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code. ...[Therefore,] making it easy to read makes it easier to write.” ([ref.](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/835238-indeed-the-ratio-of-time-spent-reading-versus-writing-is))

## Characteristics of imperative (procedural / OOP) programming

-   You specify exactly how to do something, not just the desired outcome.
-   Variables, pointers, and stored procedures are commonplace, and data is often considered mutable variables (changeable)
-   Inheritance is commonplace and typically used as an example of reusable, clean code that helps future developers

Object-oriented programming, frequently abbreviated to OOP, is the idea of having objects as a programmer-provided data structure that can be manipulated with functions. To create the objects, you need to write classes and frequently a constructor function. The keyword class was introduced into JavaScript in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), previously classes were defined in Javascript by functions.

## Prototypes and prototypal inheritance

**Prototypal Inheritance —** yes, that’s how it’s spelled — means that vanilla Javascript has objects without classes. This type of inheritance is sometimes called prototype delegation, Behavior Delegation Pattern, or OLOO (Objects Linking to Other Objects).

-   In JavaScript, it creates a link when we create the object. For objects and class inheritance, it does not copy but only links properties and behavior.
-   Diagramatically, inheritance is flowing up the chain of inheritance because it’s a behavior delegation link, also known as prototype chain.

“The problem with object-oriented languages is they’ve got all this implicit environment that they carry around with them. You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle.” ~ Joe Armstrong

**Law of Demeter**: This principle states that a class should only communicate with its immediate neighbors, rather than reaching into other objects or modules. In the context of time management, this principle can be applied by focusing on the tasks that are most relevant to your current goals and avoiding distractions or unnecessary tasks that are not directly related to your priorities.

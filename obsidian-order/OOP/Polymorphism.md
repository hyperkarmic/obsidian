Polymorphism in JavaScript

Polymorphism is one of the cores of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. It is the practice of designing objects to share behaviours and to be able to override shared behaviours with specific ones. Polymorphism takes advantage of inheritance to make this happen.

Polymorphism in JavaScript

Polymorphism is one of the cores of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. It is the practice of designing objects to share behaviours and to be able to override shared behaviours with specific ones. Polymorphism takes advantage of inheritance to make this happen.

In the context of programming, polymorphism means — in abstract terms — when programming constructs or part of a code, e.g. classes or methods, can be applied to multiple Objects of different types.

**Subtype-Polymorphism**

If people talk about polymorphism, they usually mean this type of polymorphism. This is also the most simplest kind of polymorphism. When subtyping, an object of a subtype can be used everywhere where it’s supertype is used. For example:

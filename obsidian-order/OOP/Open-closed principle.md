**Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**: This principle states that a class or module should be extensible but not modifiable. This principle can be applied in the context of time management by developing a clear and flexible schedule that allows for flexibility and adaptability. For example, you could schedule different types of tasks, such as work, exercise, and leisure, and then adjust your schedule as needed based on your priorities and changing circumstances.

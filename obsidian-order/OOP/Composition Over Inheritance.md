**Composition Over Inheritance**: To achieve flexibility and reuse in your code, this principle states that it is generally preferable to use composition (creating new behavior by combining existing objects) rather than inheritance (creating new classes by inheriting behavior from existing classes). This principle can be applied in the context of time management by combining or delegating tasks to someone or something that is specialized in that task and can do it much better than you rather than attempting to do everything yourself.

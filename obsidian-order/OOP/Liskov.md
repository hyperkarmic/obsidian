**Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: This principle states that a subclass should be able to be used in place of its superclass without affecting the correctness of the program. In the context of time management, this principle can be applied by being flexible and adaptable in your approach to tasks and being open to different ways of achieving your goals.

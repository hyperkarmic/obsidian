# Cohesion

Cohesion: **cohesion refers to the degree to which the elements inside a module belong together.**

Cohesion:Cohesion focuses on how a single class is designed. **cohesion** indicates the degree to which a class has a single purpose

The produced code will be of `high cohesion` and `low coupling`. High cohesion refers to that all code from the same domain is grouped together. Low coupling means that modules are not dependent on each other.

***


Low coupling and high cohesion are different yet complementary principles. **Low coupling encourages separation between unrelated parts of a codebase, while high cohesion encourages integration between related parts of a codebase**.
***
If we don’t follow this best practice, **we risk trending toward _high coupling and low cohesion_.** This results in excessive dependencies, which has several negative impacts. One undesirable result is an increased vulnerability to bugs, as a bug in one unit will affect its dependent units as well.

**_Cohesion_** _— refers to how tightly everything is tied to one another._**_Coupling_** _— is the process through which everything is linked together._

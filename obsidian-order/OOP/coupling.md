# coupling
****coupling**** **is the degree of interdependence between software modules; a measure of how closely connected two routines or modules are**

Coupling: **coupling** is the degree to which one class knows about and interacts with another class .Coupling is all about how classes interact with each other.

The produced code will be of `high cohesion` and `low coupling`. High cohesion refers to that all code from the same domain is grouped together. Low coupling means that modules are not dependent on each other.

# coupling
****coupling**** **is the degree of interdependence between software modules; a measure of how closely connected two routines or modules are**

Coupling: **coupling** is the degree to which one class knows about and interacts with another class .Coupling is all about how classes interact with each other.

The produced code will be of `high cohesion` and `low coupling`. High cohesion refers to that all code from the same domain is grouped together. Low coupling means that modules are not dependent on each other.

#  Low coupling and high cohesion

Low coupling and high cohesion are different yet complementary principles. **Low coupling encourages separation between unrelated parts of a codebase, while high cohesion encourages integration between related parts of a codebase**.

If we don’t follow this best practice, **we risk trending toward _high coupling and low cohesion_.** This results in excessive dependencies, which has several negative impacts. One undesirable result is an increased vulnerability to bugs, as a bug in one unit will affect its dependent units as well.

## What is the Controller in MVC?

The controller component is the intermediary between the model and the view. It is neither model nor view – it is the part that links them.

What the controller does with the view is receive and process the user requests and actions performed with the view (user interface). So, it processes requests like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT` or `PATCH`, and `DELETE`.

When the controller receives the user requests, it then communicates with the model to get what the user wants, then sends it back to the view (user interface) for the user to see.

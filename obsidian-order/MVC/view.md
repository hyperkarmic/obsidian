## What is the View in MVC?

The view component is the part the user directly interacts with. It communicates with the controller to show what the user has requested with mouse and keyboard actions.

Languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are often used to implement this part. You can use frameworks like React, Vue, and Svelte, too.

Some developers also use template engines like Handlebars, ejs, and liquidjs to implement the view.

**View:** The view is a component that displays the applicationâ€™s user interface (UI). It is created from the model data, though the data is not taken directly. It is provided by the controller, as the view interacts only with this section. A view is similar to application templates appropriate for a specific page layout type, mobile view, or a specific theme. It will display all the markups and CSS that are traditionally used for creating a static web page.

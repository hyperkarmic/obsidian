## What is MVC and why is it Used?

In Computer science, MVC is a software design pattern for organizing application code into three interwoven parts – a model, view, and controller.

The model is the logic for interacting with the database, the view is the user interface the user interacts, and the controller is the intermediary between the view and model.

In many cases, the view never interacts directly with the model – the controller performs that function.
***
The MVC design pattern aims to divide the application code into units of their own, so maintenance and optimization won’t be a hassle. This is popularly called “separation of concerns”.
***
-   **you** call a restaurant to order pizza – you are the `view`
-   you give your order to a **waiter** – the waiter is the `controller`
-   the waiter gets your pizza from the **store** and gives it to you – the store is the `model`

You can see that you, the `view`, never have to go to the store for your pizza, just like the view never retrieves data directly from the model on many occasions.

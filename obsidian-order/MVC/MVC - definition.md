# mvc - definition
MVC:The model is responsible for managing the data of the application. It receives user input from the controller.

The view renders presentation of the model in a particular format.

The controller responds to the user input and performs interactions on the data model objects. The controller receives the input, optionally validates it and then passes the input to the model.

# Advantages of using MVC

By making use of MVC, we could save a lot of time when dealing with a project that has multiple developers on it, since MVC is a way to organize our code into organized boxes and separate parts, making it easy to revisit and to change a specific logic or functionality inside it.
***
Modern applications can easily become very complex, and doing changes or general maintenance can become very impractical.

With the MVC pattern of organization an application can be organized in smaller, separate components, allowing it to be scalable, maintainable, and easy to expand.

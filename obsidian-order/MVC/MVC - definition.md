# mvc - definition
MVC:The model is responsible for managing the data of the application. It receives user input from the controller.

The view renders presentation of the model in a particular format.

The controller responds to the user input and performs interactions on the data model objects. The controller receives the input, optionally validates it and then passes the input to the model.

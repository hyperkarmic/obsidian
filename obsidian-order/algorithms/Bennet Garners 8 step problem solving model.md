# 8 step framework

Here’s my process for answering an interview question. I use this framework any time I’m in an interview, almost exactly the same every time:

1.  Ask questions & restate the intended goal — When the interviewer gives you the problem statement, ask a few clarifying questions and restate the problem in your own words. Even if you understand the problem perfectly, do this as a way to demonstrate competence.
2.  Scaffold the solution, pseudocode — Don’t immediately dive into the code. Instead, roughly outline your solution with comments/pseudocode that demonstrates your general approach & allows you to think holistically about the problem.
3.  Literally say, “Does that seem reasonable? Am I on the right track?” — At this early point in the interview, ask for feedback. Give your interviewer the opportunity to point you in a different direction. You’ll be surprised how often the interviewer says, “That sounds exactly right!” Or, “Interesting, you’re close but have you considered…” Free hints at the solution very early on!
4.  Write some of the implementation, do the easy bits — Don’t get too sucked into the hard parts yet, but replace your pseudocode with some real code so you can start running it
5.  Write happy path tests cases & a test runner — This is a HUGE competence trigger. Write some simple test cases up front to have real data for your code to run against. The goal should be to get your code running as soon as possible.
6.  Iterate on the code until it solves the happy path test cases — This is the actual work of the interview. Solve the problem. But notice how we’re only solving the problem at step 6. Up to this point, you’ve laid a great foundation for solving the problem.
7.  Look for optimizations & outright ask, “Could this be more performant?” — This is a step that many candidates miss. Work together with your interviewer to look for optimizations, if any. Discuss runtime & tradeoffs. Another big competence trigger is the ability to discuss tradeoffs and alternative implementations.
8.  Test the corner cases — When you’ve got the happy path test cases working, don’t just stop there. Another great competence trigger is demonstrating that you understand how to look for edge cases and handle errors.

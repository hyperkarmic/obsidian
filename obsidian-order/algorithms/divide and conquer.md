# Divide And Conquer
Divide and Conquer technique is used in many algorithms that are used often. That’s why it is important to understand this technique. Some Algorithms that use the Divide and Conquer algorithm are Quick sort, Merge sort, Strassen’s Algorithm etc.

The technique can be divided into three parts:

1.  **Divide:** Divide the problem into smaller sub-problems
2.  **Conquer:** Solve those sub-problems by calling them recursively until solved.
3.  **Combine:** Combine the solutions to get the final solution of the entire problem.

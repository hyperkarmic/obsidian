# Dynamic Programming
 **Dynamic programming** is a technique that breaks the problems into sub-problems, and saves the result for future purposes so that we do not need to compute the result again.

Dynamic Programming:Dynamic Programming (commonly referred to as DP) is an algorithmic technique for solving a problem by recursively breaking it down into simpler subproblems and using the fact that the optimal solution to the overall problem depends upon the optimal solution to it's individual subproblems.

The best way to study a pattern is to ask yourself what problem it tries to solve, then consider a naïve solution to that problem and compare it to the one proposed by the pattern. Trying to apply both solutions to a realistic example is also a very helpful way to internalize those concepts. Only after that we should start discussing the pattern in terms of specific paradigms.

-   Dynamic programming emphasizes on overlapping subproblems, while backtracking focus on all or some solutions.
-   Dynamic programming relies on the principle of optimality, while backtracking uses a brute force approach.
-   Dynamic programming is more like breadth-first search (BFS), building up one layer at a time, while backtracking is more like depth-first search (DFS), building up one solution first.
-   Dynamic programming usually takes more space than backtracking, by memoizing all the optimal sub**-**solutions for later use.
-   Backtracking usually takes more time to execute, by iterating all or some solutions.

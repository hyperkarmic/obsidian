# hashing


The Hashing technique uses a process of transforming any key or given string of values into another value. Just like other algorithms, it makes the original string turn into a shorter value or key which is easier to understand.

Hashing is used in Data indexing and retrieval, cybersecurity and cryptography.

In solving development problems, developers use the hashing technique to map keys and values into a hash table.

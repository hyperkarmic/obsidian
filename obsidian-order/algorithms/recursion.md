# Recursion
 
 ## **Recursion** is a method of solving a computational problem where the solution depends on solutions to tiny instances of the same problem.
 <hr>
 Recursion:The difference between a `recursion` and a `loop` is that `recursions` are self-contained and produce a specific output based on input. A loop runs linearly and demands each succession to be executed in order to produce a result.
***
Recursion: JavaScript’s routine for handling recursion is known as tail recursion, a stack-based implementation of recursion. This means that, for every recursive call, there is a new frame in the stack.

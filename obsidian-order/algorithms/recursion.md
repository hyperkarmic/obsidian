# Recursion
 
 ## **Recursion** is a method of solving a computational problem where the solution depends on solutions to tiny instances of the same problem.
 <hr>
 Recursion:The difference between a `recursion` and a `loop` is that `recursions` are self-contained and produce a specific output based on input. A loop runs linearly and demands each succession to be executed in order to produce a result.

Graphql: A mash up of SQL and Rest Api’s!!!!!
***
GraphQL: GraphQL is a query language that provides a way to ask for __the data__ (here is the catch!) from the server via the [API](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-an-api-in-english-please-b880a3214a82/) (hmm that sounds simple!)

## GraphQL core principles

GraphQL is built on a set of core principles that differentiate it from other API technologies:

1.  **Strongly-typed schema**: GraphQL APIs are based on a strongly-typed schema, which defines the types of data, queries, and mutations available. This provides a clear contract between the client and server, making it easier to understand and validate the data being exchanged.
2.  **Hierarchical data structure**: GraphQL organizes data in a hierarchical structure, making it simple to represent complex relationships between entities. This mirrors the way data is typically consumed by applications, leading to more intuitive queries and responses.
3.  **Client-driven queries**: With GraphQL, clients can request only the data they need, specifying the desired fields and relationships. This eliminates over-fetching and under-fetching, resulting in more efficient data retrieval and reduced network overhead.
4.  **Single endpoint**: Unlike REST, GraphQL uses a single endpoint for all data types and operations. This simplifies the API architecture and makes it easier to manage and evolve over time.

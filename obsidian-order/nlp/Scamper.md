# Scamper
Creativity technique used to generate ideas, consisting of answering a list of seven questions. In practice, the method consists simply of considering what can be substituted, combined, adapted, modified, put to other uses, eliminated, or rearranged when it comes to improving a product or service or tackling a problem. Scamper is a mnemonic acronym for remembering these seven actions:

S – Substitute

C – Combine

A – Adapt

M – Modify

P – Put to other uses

E – Eliminate

R – Rearrange

Scamper was created by Bob Eberlee on the basis of a verbal checklist that had previously been created by Alex F. Osborn, the inventor of brainstorming.

# root cause analysis

Before starting to solve a problem, we need to understand the root cause first. Often we find out after many trials that the cause differs from what we’ve expected.

By eliminating the false reasons, we’ll have a better definition of our problem and become closer to the solution. The root cause analysis methods help to avoid wasting time and energy in trying to make a fix in the wrong place.![[root-cause.jpg]]

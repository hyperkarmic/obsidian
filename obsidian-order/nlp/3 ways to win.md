# 3 ways to win

Charles Ellis 
##### losers game dude!!!!

is a renowned investment consultant and believes there are 3 ways to succeed as an investor intellectually, physically or emotionally ([article link](https://jasonzweig.com/wall-streets-wisest-man/))

-   **Intellectually** — be smarter than other investors
-   **Physically** — out work other investors by working at night and weekends
-   **Emotionally** — be a contrarian, when people are selling you buy

*The intellectual way is how we would all like to succeed: being so smart that we understand things more clearly and see farther ahead than every other investor. The pre-eminent example, obviously, is Warren Buffett. But people like him are very, very, very rare.

The physical way to succeed is simply to work harder, to start at dawn and grind away till midnight and carry home a heavy briefcase full of research and keep working right on through the weekend too. This way is the most popular on Wall Street, where nearly everyone seems to try it.*

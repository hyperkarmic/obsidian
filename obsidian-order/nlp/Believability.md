Ray Dalio calls this believability. You need to assess the believability of the person you are talking to.

> The most believable opinions are those of people who 1) have repeatedly and successfully accomplished the thing in question, and 2) have demonstrated that they can logically explain the cause-effect relationships behind their conclusions. [principles](https://www.principles.com/principles/633d5d13-8610-425f-ad62-cd62347d9165/)

When you talk to developers you need to consider the believability of the developer. This is based on

-   Skills
-   Experience
-   Knowledge

Assess if a developer is a cowboy and the gap between their skills and their opinion of their skills. You need this knowledge to help assess their ideas and input.

Cowboy developers want to create code fast and don’t worry about quality or process. You should consider this when they put forward solutions and ideas. Make sure you talk through the actions, so it aligns with the development teams approach and not just get it done fast.

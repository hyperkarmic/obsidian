# mind palace for code
If you want to create your own coding memory palace, I call the it the **Realm And Code (RAC)** , here are five tips for you:

1.  Imagine a building or a location for each technology you learn eg. castle for. JavaScript. You have to see it in your imagination.
2.  Imagine characteristic places in the building eg. library room can be dedicated to string operations.
3.  Place creatures and items in the room. The weirder it gets, the easier your mind will remember it. Our mind loves to remember weird stuff surprisingly.
4.  Put life into that scene. Let things happen there.
5.  Treat your memory realm as a garden. Take care of it, organize it, add new things.

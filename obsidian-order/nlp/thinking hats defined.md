## Thinking hats
![[thinking.jpg]]
### white hat 👒⚗️🤍
### red hat  ⛑️🔥❤️
-   **Red Hat:** Gives permission to forward hunches without needing to justify them.
### yellow hat 👷👍💛
-   **Yellow Hat:** Why you think something will work; the savings, the benefits, and the advantages; usually forward-thinking.
### green hat 🪖☘️💚
-   **Green Hat:** Proposals, suggestions, ideas, alternatives, provocations, and what is interesting in an idea.
### blue hat 👮🏾🗓️💙
-   **Blue Hat:** Looks not at the subject of the thinking but at the thinking itself and is used for building, managing, and concluding the process, including using and sequencing use of the other hats.
### black hat 🎩💣🖤
-   **Black Hat:** The black hat makes us consider the reasons why something may not work, why it may be illegal, why it may go wrong, or why it’s not worth doing but the reason must be logical (if it’s emotional, that is red hat).
### purple hat 👾 👑💜
-   **Purple Hat:** The Royal hat reflects the perspective of the owner who is both committed and invested in the meeting output and project outcome. May have difficulty switching perspectives because they own return on the investment.

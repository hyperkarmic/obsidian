# 12 more what elses
In her book, [The Architecture of All Abundance](https://www.amazon.com/Architecture-All-Abundance-Foundations-Prosperity-ebook/dp/B004OL24C8), author Lenedra J. Carroll introduced a simple technique called “The 12 What Elses” for getting out of a problem:

When brainstorming solutions, ask yourself a question and generate 12 answers to that problem. Then take one answer, turn it into a question, and generate 12 more answers. Repeat until you can see a clear solution.

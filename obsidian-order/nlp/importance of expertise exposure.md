# importance of expertise exposure
![[expertise.png]]

_“After enough exposure with feedback, your brain [begins] detecting patterns and underlying structures, without your conscious awareness. With_ more _exposure, your brain [fine-tunes] its perception and eventually [figures] out what_ really _[matters]. Your brain [is] making finer distinctions and sorting signal from noise even if_ you _[can’t] explain how._Perceptual knowledge _includes what we think of as expert_ intuition_. The ability to instantly know_ which _chess move to make. Or that_ this _painting is a_ forgery_. Or that_ this _house fire will_ explode_. Or that there’s_ something _wrong with that code, even though you can’t always articulate_ how _you know.”_

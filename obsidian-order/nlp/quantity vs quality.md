# quantity vs quality in training
# Quantity Leads To Quality

As David Bayles and Ted Orland write in [_Art and Fear_](http://www.amazon.ca/Art-Fear-Observations-Rewards-Artmaking/dp/0961454733):

> The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups. Students on the left side of the studio would be rated on quantity, while students on the right would be graded on quality.
> 
> His procedure was simple:
> 
> On the final day of class, he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the “quantity” group: fifty pounds of pots rated an “A”, forty pounds a “B”, and so on.
> 
> However, those graded on “**quality**” needed to produce only one pot — albeit a perfect one — to get an “A”.
> 
> Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the group graded for quantity produced the highest quality works.
> 
> It seems that while the “quantity” group was busily churning out piles of work — and learning from their mistakes.
> 
> The “quality” group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end, had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.

-   Don’t get too hung up initially on polishing your work to **perfection**. Instead, focus on cranking out as much as you can.
-   Doing something will lead to doing it well.

# novices vs experts
## Experts

1.  They have large and rich schemata, organized representations of things or events that guide someone’s thoughts and actions. These schemata are highly interconnected in a way that lets retrieving one piece of information easily lead to the retrieval of another piece.
2.  They use a **working-forward strategy**.
3.  They **monitor their problem-solving** carefully.
4.  They possess far greater knowledge in specific domains.
5.  They allocate more time to determining how to represent a problem — **the preparatory stages of problem-solving** — and spend less time executing solutions.
6.  Their thought reveals more complex and sophisticated representations of problems.
7.  They are more successful in reaching appropriate solutions.

## Novices

1.  They use a working-backward strategy: They begin by focusing on the goal.
2.  They don’t monitor their problem-solving carefully.
3.  They spend relatively more of their time executing solutions.
4.  They are less successful in reaching appropriate solutions.

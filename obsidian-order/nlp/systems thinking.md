# Systems Thinking

Peter Senge: 12 rules
1.  **Law 1:** Today’s problems come from yesterday’s “solutions.”
2.  **Law 2:** The harder you push, the harder the system pushes back.
3.  **Law 3:** Behavior grows better before it grows worse.
4.  **Law 4:** The easy way out usually leads back in.
5.  **Law 5:** The cure can be worse than the disease.
6.  **Law 6:** Faster is slower.
7.  **Law 7:** Cause and effect are not closely related in time and space.
8.  **Law 8:** Small changes can produce big results… but the areas of highest leverage are often the least obvious.
9.  **Law 9:** You can have your cake and eat it too — but not all at once.
10.  **Law 10:** Dividing an elephant in half does not produce two small elephants.
11.  **Law 11:** There is no blame.

“The discipline of systems thinking is more than just a collection of tools and methods — it’s also an underlying philosophy. Many beginners are attracted to the tools […] in hopes that these tools will help them deal with persistent business problems. But systems thinking is also a sensitivity to the circular nature of the world we live in.” — [Systems Thinking: What, Why, When, Where, and How](https://thesystemsthinker.com/systems-thinking-what-why-when-where-and-how/)

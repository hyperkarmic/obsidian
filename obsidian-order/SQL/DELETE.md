## Delete data from a database

For deleting data you need the DELETE keyword. For example:

DELETE FROM customers WHERE customer_id = 12345;

***


This SQL query will delete the data from the “customers” table where the “customer_id” is equal to 12345. It will remove any row in the table that meets this condition. The “DELETE FROM” clause indicates the table to delete data from, and the “WHERE” clause specifies the condition to match the rows to be deleted. In this case, the row with a customer_id of 12345 will be deleted.

## Retrieve data from a database

For retrieving data, you are using the SELECT keyword. Here is an example of a basic SELECT query in SQL:

SELECT * FROM customers;

This query will select all columns and rows from the customers table.

Here is another example that selects specific columns and filters the results using a WHERE clause:

SELECT name, email FROM customers WHERE city = 'New York';

#SELECT #SQL

# SQL - Definition'

SQL is a set-based, declarative programming language, not an imperative SQL programming language like C or BASIC. In other words, SQL is a query language that is **structured**, set-based, and declarative.
***
SQL is a **database** language for interacting with relational databases. It allows the creation of database functions such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data.

**SQL** stands for Structured Query Language, and it’s a programming language that’s used to interface with databases and alter their contents. Such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data.
***
SQL means Structured Query Language, and it isn’t even an actual programming language like a C/C#/Java or Python. It is more like a set of commands in a fixed order to query data from relational database tables.

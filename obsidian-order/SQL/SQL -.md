SQL is a **database** language for interacting with relational databases. It allows the creation of database functions such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data.

**SQL** stands for Structured Query Language, and it’s a programming language that’s used to interface with databases and alter their contents. Such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data.

SQL means Structured Query Language, and it isn’t even an actual programming language like a C/C#/Java or Python. It is more like a set of commands in a fixed order to query data from relational database tables.

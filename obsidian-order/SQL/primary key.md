# Primary Key

 The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each row in a table. It must contain UNIQUE values and has an implicit NOT NULL constraint. A table in SQL is strictly restricted to have one and only one primary key, which is comprised of single or multiple fields (columns).
 ***
 Primary keys and foreign keys: In a SQL database, a primary key is a unique identifier for each row in a table. A foreign key is a column in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. Foreign keys are used to establish relationships between tables.

Queries are a fundamental aspect of working with databases. They allow us to retrieve and manipulate data from one or more tables. A query is a statement that asks a database to retrieve information from the data stored in its tables. It is written in Structured Query Language (SQL) and can be as simple or as complex as necessary.

Query Commenting Query commenting is the process of adding comments to a query to make it more understandable. Comments are annotations in the SQL code that explain what the code is doing or provide additional context. In SQL, comments are indicated by two dashes (â€“) or enclosed in /* */.

Query Composition Query composition is the process of constructing a query using SQL. It involves selecting the data from one or more tables, filtering the data using conditions, and sorting the data as needed. SQL provides a wide range of keywords and functions to help us compose queries, such as SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY.

Query Composition Best Practices There are several best practices that can help you compose effective queries. These include:

-   Use meaningful column names: Make sure that the names of the columns in the SELECT statement are descriptive and easy to understand.
    
-   Use aliases: Use column aliases to make the output of a query more readable.
    
-   Use formatting: Use formatting to make the SQL code more readable and easier to understand.
    
-   Use comments: Use comments to provide context and explain the purpose of the query.
    

Column Custom Names Column custom names are used to create aliases for the column names in a query. Aliases are useful when the column names are too long or not descriptive enough. To use a custom name, you can use the AS keyword, followed by the alias name.

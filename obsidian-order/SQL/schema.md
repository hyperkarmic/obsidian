# schema
Schema: Schemas define the structure of data/document.

**Schema** (aka: data model) is a metadata describing the data type, formats, and validation rules. Schema can be defined for content body, header, path or query parameters, etc.

Schema:A database schema is an abstract design that represents the storage of your data in a database

Schema:A database schema ia ****blueprint**** or ****architecture**** of how our data will look. It doesn’t hold data itself, but instead describes the shape of the data and how it might relate to other tables or models. An entry in our database will be an instance of the database schema. It will contain all of the properties described in the schema.

_Think of a database schema as a type of data structure. It represents the framework and arrangement of the contents of an organization’s data._

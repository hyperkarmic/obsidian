Cash which wasn't accounted for was found in large safes at his two principal homes and more bagged up and hidden in three safety deposit boxes, the court heard.

Mr Sheibani, from [Bowdon](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/bowdon), Trafford, paid over £500,000 into his bank accounts to pay off credit card bills and was said to have a bitcoin allowance of up to £136,000, prosecutors allege.

Opening the case, Nicholas Clarke QC told jurors Mr Sheibani’s dealings with properties in the UK and Spain ‘played a large part in his criminal enterprise’.

“The defendant has been linked to the ownership of 22 properties in the UK since 2000 including a flat in London that was bought for £1.74 million in 2016,” Mr Clarke QC said.

It is alleged Mr Sheibani spent several years purchasing, re-mortgaging and selling properties in the UK and Spain by lying about what his income was and where it came from.

He went on to produce forged documents, including bank statements and P60s, to support his false declared earnings, jurors have been told.
“He has not declared all the income from tenants or the profits made on sales of the properties from here or in Spain to HMRC and so he hasn’t bothered to pay all of the tax due on the rents or the capital gains tax due on his profits,” the prosecutor told the court.

“When he wanted more cash, he bought properties in other people's names and later had them transferred into his name for no monetary consideration at all.”

Mr Sheibani used the cash for living expenses, meals out, expensive branded clothes, foreign travel with luxury accommodation abroad and costly cosmetic surgery for himself and his girlfriend, jurors were told.

This included teeth veneers, two hair transplants and a nose job for Mr Shiebani, and other cosmetic surgery for his partner, the court heard.

Mr Clarke QC said: “There is no evidence of any paid employment or self-assessed earnings before 2002 and since then there have been periods where no declarations of earnings have been submitted at all.”

A takeaway boss has avoided jail after he admitted evading more than £70,000 in VAT payments.

Irfan Khan, 38, dodged jail after he was found to have not paid the tax while he ran two kebab houses from the same premises on Wilmslow Road in Withington.

The total sum he had evaded came to £71,204.21 over a six-year period.

Manchester Crown Court heard that this was despite Khan receiving warnings from Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs about his obligations.

At one stage, Khan, from Burnage, told the probation service he denied wrong doing and sought to blame his now deceased father, and his accountants.

"You knew the responsibilities on you as a director," Judge Michael Leeming said.

Khan avoided jail after a judge heard any prison sentence would impact his wife and five children, who rely on him.

Prosecutors said that the total amount evaded only took into account takings from online orders received via Just Eat and Hungry House.

The court heard because records of sales from walk-in and telephone customers were not found, investigators could only use the online orders where sales totals were logged.

Khan told police that his online orders represented about 40 per cent of his total takings, with the rest coming via walk-in and telephone customers, the court was told.

Prior to his arrest, officers from HMRC visited Khan's premises and spoke to him about keeping records.

Fraudster Ali Bana Mohamed cheated the child benefit and tax credit system out of more than [£1.7 million pounds - with claims for 188 FAKE children](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/group-fraudsters-involved-17million-benefit-23282874). He used people he knew from Birmingham and London to assist in the scam. This involved submitting bogus claims in about 70 different names.

They got away with the brazen scheme until suspicions were aroused by the HMRC. The tax office spotted that the same two telephone numbers were repeatedly calling the tax credits claims call centre in connection with seemingly unrelated claims and a dedicated DWP investigation was launched.

In March, six of the fraudsters received jail sentences totalling more than 13 years. One of them had his term suspended.

Mastermind Mohamed, 40, of Epping Street, Hulme, Manchester, was jailed for three and a half years in January after admitting 29 fraud offences. He was already serving 16 years for drugs and immigration offences and the judge, who ordered the sentence to run consecutively, said it would have been longer but for his existing sentence.

His fraud was targeted on the UK’s tax credit and child benefit system. A dedicated investigation led to establishing that Ali Bana Mohamed had advanced child benefit and tax credit claims in approximately 70 different adult names over a nine year period between April 2007 and July 2016.

All the fraudulent claims advanced by Ali Bana Mohamed were made on the basis that the adult was looking after the named children and was entitled to child benefit and tax credits.

Kevin Slack, prosecuting said: “Those children were fictitious. In all, 188 different children, whom were entirely fictitious, were claimed for in these claims. In total, £1,766,594.87 was paid out in relation to these fraudulent claims, comprising £345,642.80 in child benefit payments and £1,420,952.07 in tax credit payments.”

Kevin Slack, prosecuting, told the court that the defendants were in the dock as part of Operation Paratrooper which involved an investigation by the DWP’s Serious and Organised Crime section.

His fraud was targeted on the UK’s tax credit and child benefit system. A dedicated investigation led to establishing that Ali Bana Mohamed had advanced child benefit and tax credit claims in approximately 70 different adult names over a nine year period between April 2007 and July 2016.

Mr Slack explained that In some cases, adults had their identities hijacked. Four of the defendants allowed fraudulent claims to be advanced in their names and actively participated in those frauds, obtaining varying amounts.

All the fraudulent claims advanced by Ali Bana Mohamed were made on the basis that the adult had care of named children and was entitled to child benefit and tax credits.

“Those children were fictitious. In all, 188 different children, whom were entirely fictitious, were claimed for in these claims. In total, £1,766,594.87 was paid out in relation to these fraudulent claims, comprising £345,642.80 in child benefit payments and £1,420,952.07 in tax credit payments.”

Mr Slack said, “Ali Bana Mohamed had a relatively simple, yet effective means, of storing all the information he needed to run these false claims. When his house in Epping Street, Moss Side, Manchester, was searched in April 2016, immigration investigators found several handwritten note books hidden under clothing at the back of a wardrobe. “

A handwriting expert concluded that the handwriting in these notebooks was that Ali Bana Mohamed.

Mr Slack said that the note books “typically listed the identities being used to pursue claims, the names and dates of birth of the fictitious children, the bank account and sort code of the bank into which the payments were being made and details of the telephone passwords used when phoning up in connection with those claims.

“Ali Bana Mohamed had several bank accounts in either his own name or the name of a pseudonym of his into which some of the proceeds of the frauds were paid. He also had payments directed into accounts in the names of other people, including accounts operated in the names of the defendants.”

Two of the defendants, Mohammed Omar and Mohamoud Baana, denied their roles and during their trial the jury heard that the suspicious phone numbers received by HRMC were discovered to belong to Ali Bana Mohamed which led to investigations.

“He had several bank accounts in either his own name or the name of a pseudonym of his into which some of the proceeds of the frauds were paid. He also had payments directed into accounts in the names of other people, including accounts operated in the names of the defendants.

“He was the orchestrator of the frauds. In many cases, he was able toact alone, as when arranging for a claim to be paid into one of his own bank accounts. However, in other cases he needed the help of others and the other defendants agreed to pursue specific frauds with him,” said Mr Slack.

Mohamed Maye Omar’s role involved obtaining birth certificates which could be used by Ali Bana Mohamed to carry out fraud.

Mohamoud Baana, 48, of Shotton Walk, Rusholme, Manchester, and Mohamed Omar, 36, a father-of-six, of Caythorpe Street, Moss Side, Manchester were found guilty after their trial. Baana was jailed for two years nine months and Omar received two years.

Omar Abdi, 41, of Brentwood Street, Moss Side, Saleh Mohamed, 38, brother of Ali Bana Mohamed, of Romford Road, Forest Gate, London pleaded guilty as did Ali Bana Mohamed’s nephew, Rashid Ahmed, 31, of Hogdsons Tower, Guildford Drive, Birmingham and Hamza Hashim, 41, of Gantock Walk, Moss Side.

Abdi received 13 months imprisonment suspended for two years; Mohamed two years eight months and Hashim received three years two months.

The court was told that both Hashim and Saleh Mohammed have previous fraud convictions and had suspended sentences hanging over them at the time of the offences.

Rashid Ahmed also has previous convictions for fraud. Mohammed Baana has two convictions, the most recent for perverting the course of justice. Omar Abdi has no previous convictions and Mohamed Omar has a conviction for importing drugs for which he received a suspended sentence. The fraud begin immediately after that sentence was imposed.

A barrister found guilty of wrongfully claiming council tax benefit is to have her conviction reviewed. Asma 'Sky' Bibi, of Ancoats, was given a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £1,000 costs in June 2018 after being found guilty at Warrington Magistrates' Court of falsely claiming council tax support over a 17-month period.

The court heard she earned almost £40,000 in that time. Miss Bibi later appealed against both the sentence and conviction.

In September 2019, at Chester Crown Court, that appeal was dismissed and a judge increased her sentence, handing her a 12-month community order and a 28 day curfew with £2,585 costs. Now the Criminal Cases Review Commission has referred the case back to Chester Crown Court (CCRC) after it decided there is a 'real possibility the prosecution was invalid as proceedings were not issued within the time limits'.

In a statement the CCRC said: "After careful consideration, the CCRC has decided to refer Ms Bibi’s conviction to Chester Crown Court, based on an argument that her original prosecution by Manchester City Council was ‘out of time’. The Council Tax Regulations state that proceedings must be started in the magistrates’ court (known as “laying an information”) either within 12 months of the completion of the alleged offence or within three months of evidence, sufficient in the opinion of the prosecutor (in this case Manchester City Council) to justify a prosecution for the offence, coming to the attention of the prosecutor.

"According to the charge, the offence concluded on September 6, 2016, but the information was not laid until November 15, 2017, over 14 months later. In the CCRC’s view there is a real possibility the Crown Court will find that the date on which there was sufficient knowledge by the prosecutor was either March 17, 2017 (when legal proceedings were recommended by the investigator) or July 19, 2017 (when the head of the Fraud Department authorised the case being passed to the Legal Department for prosecution).

The owner of a Chinese takeaway ended up in court for evading £158,000 in tax when his accounts were investigated using information from fast food apps such as Just Eat, a court heard.

Shou Xue Ling, 42, has run the Long Rong takeaway on Ashton New Road in east Manchester since 2012.

He admitted fraudulently evading income tax and VAT from 2014 to 2018, Manchester Crown Court heard.

Sentencing judge Richard Mansell QC said Ling's crimes were revealed due to the more frequent use of apps to buy takeaway food, rather than the traditional cash purchases.

Prosecutors said he had defrauded the taxpayer out of £158,000, a figure disputed by the defence.

The judge told the defendant: "Ironically, your offending has been revealed by the evidence now available to HM Customs and Excise investigators which has likely seen your takings increase, namely the Just Eat app and others like them.

"Whereas traditionally, customers of takeaways like yours would either ring or walk in their orders, and often pay cash, now many order their food from the comfort of their own home.

"The payments have to go through the Just Eat app and your business, and many others like yours, have been investigated and shown to have been fraudulently evading VAT and income tax by under-declaring takings."

A sentencing hearing heard that the income from the takeaway was below the VAT threshold, but it later began to exceed that level.

Despite this, Ling did not declare it to the authorities. He also didn't declare the actual level of income generated, reducing the amount of income tax he should have paid.

Judge Mansell said he was able to spare Ling jail as he has no previous convictions, and because he provided for his family by working hard in the takeaway business.

A plumbing firm boss who evaded tens thousands of pounds in tax whilst buying luxury cars and sending his kids to private school has been handed a suspended jail term.

Shazad Hassan, 40, who ran Superb Gas and Plumbing Services, lied about his income and failed to pay more than £65,000 owed for the ten years the company was trading, a court was told.

An HMRC investigation found his firm had paid no VAT and that the dad, from Stockport, had paid just £750 in Income Tax between 2004 and 2014 when it was operating.

Meanwhile, he had spent £45,000 on advertising his business as well as buying several high-value vehicles, including an Audi RS6 costing more than £83,000, a BMW 116d SE for £19,484, and a VW Transporter Van for £23,000. He also spent £61,000 on private school fees for his children.

On Monday he was sentenced to two years in prison, suspended for two years, plus 300 hours of unpaid work and a three month curfew.

He was also ordered to repay £65,000 to HMRC within three months or serve a compulsory default jail sentence of 18 months for late or non payment.

Speaking after the case, Sandra Smith, Assistant Director for HMRC’s Fraud Investigation Service said: “Hassan lived a very comfortable lifestyle while pocketing taxes he owed. He lied about his income deliberately in an attempt to evade paying VAT and other taxes.

“It is foolhardy to attempt to hide trading and spending on this scale from HMRC and it is unfair in the current commercial climate.

“Evading tax isn’t a victimless crime. It takes money out of the public services that everyone in the UK relies.

“If you suspect fraud similar to this report it to the HMRC 24-hour Hotline on 0800 788 887 or online via Gov.uk – search for ‘HMRC reporting fraud’.”

**Two Greater Manchester company directors who hid money in offshore accounts to avoid paying £500,000 in tax have been jailed for fraud.**

Roderick Smith, 44, of Standish, and Stephen Howarth, 44, of Gee Cross, failed to declare profits from their IT company held in Isle of Man accounts.

Smith admitted cheating the Revenue and fraud, while Howarth admitted fraud at Liverpool Crown Court.

Smith was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment and Howarth to 12 months.

A HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) spokeswoman said the pair, who ran Goldlogic Control Systems Ltd - a company offering computer technology to the car trade - had "the opportunity to disclose their offshore accounts through HMRC's Offshore Disclosure Facility (ODF) in 2007".

"Howarth did not register for the ODF, while Smith did register but then disclosed only one of the 12 accounts he controlled overseas," she said.

HRMC inspectors uncovered the fraud after being alerted by tax authorities in Germany, where many of the pair's customers were based.

Investigators found sales totalling £1,255,615 in Germany, while the pair only declared £49,650.

The spokeswoman said the balance had been "siphoned off into the offshore accounts of five shell companies registered in Mauritius and the Isle of Man created by the directors solely for the purpose of tax fraud".

She added that the prosecutions were the first involving the ODF in the UK.

Passing sentence, Judge Robert Warnock said the pair had "cheated the Revenue, and therefore this country, by evasion of income tax".

"The authors of your references will be shocked and disappointed at what in effect were crimes motivated by greed and selfishness," he said.

"Only sentences of imprisonment are appropriate in respect of the offences you have committed [as] to suspend these sentences would offend any reasonable sense of justice on the part of the honest taxpayer."

Confiscation orders were issued against Smith for £300,000 and Howarth for £200,000, with the condition that a failure to pay the money within 24 months would see them receive another 15 months and 12 months in prison respectively.

[Manchester Businessman jailed for £250,000 VAT Fraud | DESIblitz](https://www.desiblitz.com/content/manchester-businessman-jailed-for-250000-vat-fraud)

Chaudhry Akbar, aged 50, of Fairfields Road, Manchester, was jailed for 18 months on Monday, January 21, 2019, at Manchester Crown Court after stealing more than £250,000 in VAT repayments.

An investigation by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) revealed he used his two waste management businesses to fraudulently claim the money through VAT repayments.

It was heard Akbar had submitted 36 fraudulent invoices over a period between June 2013 and November 2015 while he was working as the director of Manchester-based companies Thermal Power Ltd and Hyder Engineering (UK) Ltd.

According to Companies House, the nature of business for Thermal Power Ltd was remediation activities and other waste management services.

Meanwhile, Hyder Engineering (UK) Ltd’s operations were focused on the recovery of sorted materials.

The court heard that Akbar forged paperwork by making up business purchases for heavy machinery and goods.

He then laundered the cash in an attempt to avoid being detected by HMRC fraud investigators.

HMRC investigators found Akbar passed the stolen money through a number of bank accounts in an attempt to hide the cash.

It was found that the businessman fraudulently claimed a total of £253,426 between June 2013 and November 2015 through this method.

Akbar was arrested and charged with VAT fraud and money laundering.

Nine people have been arrested after a series of police raids targeting people selling counterfeit goods.

The raids took place on Monday this week across the Cheetham Hill area of North Manchester with officers from Greater Manchester Police in actions alongside other forces and agencies.

As well as the nine people arrested, police seized what they describes as “large quantities” of counterfeit goods, drugs and cash.

Detective Superintendent Neil Blackwood said: “This week of intensification is about so much more than the counterfeit goods trade, which Cheetham Hill and more specifically the Strangeways area is nationally known for.

“The trade, which often involves organised [crime](https://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/crime/) groups, is strongly linked to money laundering and immigration offences. We also know the area is a hotspot for sexual offences and traffic offences.

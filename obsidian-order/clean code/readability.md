# readability
As a developer, how much time do you spend reading code vs writing code? 50% read, 50% writing? No, itâ€™s more like 80% reading vs 20% writing, with studies even suggesting 90% reading and 10% writing.

You will be reading code 90% of the time. Therefore making sure your code is understandable is a key priority. Code that works is easy to write. Code that others can understand is a much more significant challenge.

# partials
_Partials:_ _Partials_ are smaller, context-aware components in your list and page _templates_ that can be used economically to keep your templating DRY.

Partial:Template partials are small bits of reusable template or tag parts. You could create a Template partial for any number of purposes, anywhere that you need to reuse a small portion of a template, including partial or complete tags, other variables, etc. Template partials add flexibility and reusability, while making it simple to make site-wide changes by editing the Template partial’s source instead of having to modify many templates.

Partial:Handlebars allows for template reuse through partials. Partials are normal Handlebars templates that may be called directly by other templates.

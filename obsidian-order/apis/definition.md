# API definitions
  

API: stands for "Application Programming Interface" which is a tool that allows two applications to talk to each other

API: However, the true nature of an API is that it is an interface that connects two applications together.

# API
Think of an API like a menu in a restaurant.

The menu contains a list of foods. Order the food you want. The restaurant serves food. You don’t know how the food was prepared.

Api:An API is like a menu that provides a list of operations. The developer doesn’t know how that API works.

APIs are just pieces of code that help two server applications (backend) or one client application(frontend) and one server application to communicate. This communication is essential for any modern application to work. Therefore, APIs are considered the backbone of the latest software and/or services.

API:An application programming interface (API) is a link between two computers or applications. It’s a form of software interface that provides a service to other programs. An API specification is a document or standard that explains how to create or utilize a connection or interface.

API: An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is an intermediary software or program that enables 2 applications to talk to each other and share. A public API is open and available for use by any outside developer or business.

API: An API (Application Programming Interface) is just a set of commands that let two programs (or websites or systems) talk to each other (send data back and forth).  For example, the Google Maps API lets you get data from Google Maps and use it on your page.

_Api:__An API is a set of rules, routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. APIs are the language that systems or programs use to communicate with each other._

Api: Put simply, an API is a “handshake” between your application and another service.

  Api:  APIs are like fictional cars, which can carry the same passengers (data) by different means- land, air, and water. They know exactly what medium to use when commuting to different places (programs).

If I have to say in simple words what APIs do, I will say, APIs are just services that return some kind of data on demand. This data can be anything such as an image file, sound file, raw text, etc.

API stands for an application programming interface. It is the back-end side of your web application and it’s usually run on your server. The API is always used to serve your front-end and can be also used as an interface to be integrated by a third party. An API is composed of a collection of services to get or to push data to your back-end server.

# Types of API. The Past, Present and the Future!

Throughout the history of APIs, there have been mainly three kinds.

1.  RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
2.  SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
3.  REST (Representational State Transfer)

**RPC** or **Remote Procedure Call** APIs seem to be the most **simple and ancient** APIs. In general, RPC requires developers or clients to run a block of code on a server. RPC-style makes it possible for developers to easily create and invoke multiple programs and services on a server. Nowadays, you won’t see much use of RPC APIs. There are two sub-type of RPC APIs:

-   **XML-RPC:** A XML-RPC is basically an RPC API coded in return XML formatted data.
-   **JSON-RPC:** A JSON-RPC is basically an RPC API coded to return JSON formatted data.

**SOAP** or **Simple Object Access Protocol** uses XML format to transfer data over HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP). SOAP uses Web Services Definition Language(WSDL) to publish the definition of its interface. Before the REST APIs came into the picture, SOAP had dominance on how APIs were created back then. SOAP was the first API protocol that can be created and invoked on any kind of operating system and, two decades ago, it was a huge deal.

**REST** or **Representational State Transfer** is a modern web services API. REST follows an architectural style instead of a generic protocol style. The main benefit of this style is it detaches consumers and providers. It means, because of its architectural style, consumers can use it without worrying about its underlying protocols. REST APIs support both JSON and XML formats. But most developers prefer JSON format as it is easy to use and read. Currently, REST is the most popular type of API. If you research, you will find that Netflix, Amazon, Google or any other giant tech company uses REST APIs in their products.

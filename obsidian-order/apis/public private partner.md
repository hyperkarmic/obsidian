# Accessibility of APIs

Not every API is a public API. There are many private and partner APIs as well. **Public APIs** are the APIs that can be accessed by any person in the world. It can be free, paid or on a subscription base. **Private APIs** can be developed by the organization for internal uses. Private APIs can be used in products that are available to the public. **Partner APIs** are the kind of APIs whose access is restricted to some user, or these APIs can be used with some Applications or services only. For example, Twitter API is a public API. But, there might be some APIs that Twitter is using for some internal tasks. Now, if some organization has created some API that can only be used with certain services of other organizations, then it will be called partner API.

# General Use of APIs and Basic Functionalities of APIs

As a developer, we use and develop APIs for many purposes and for many use-cases. Some of those use-cases are:

1.  To fetch data from the server (Database)
2.  To add data to the Database
3.  To update record (data) in the Database
4.  To delete record in the Database
5.  To validate a user or for authentication
6.  To request other services (s) to perform some operations

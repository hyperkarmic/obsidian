# Clean Code
## [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)

by Robert Martin

Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn’t have to be that way.

Clean Code is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code―of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and “smells” gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code.

Read this book, and you’ll learn how to:

-   How to tell the difference between good and bad code
-   How to write good code and how to transform bad code into good code
-   How to create good names, good functions, good objects, and good classes
-   How to format code for maximum readability
-   How to implement complete error handling without obscuring code logic
-   How to unit test and practice test-driven development
-   What “smells” and heuristics can help you identify bad code

This book is a must for any developer, software engineer, project manager, team lead, or systems analyst with an interest in producing better code.

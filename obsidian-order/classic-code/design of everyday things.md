# Design Of Everyday Things
## Don Norman
### Patrick Klein Notes
-   Allow people to continue with their task: Don't impede progressâ€”help make it smooth and continuous. Never make people start over
    
-   Eliminate all error messages from electronic or computer systems. Instead, provide help and guidance
    
-   We need to remove the word failure from our vocabulary, replac- ing it instead with learning experience. To fail is to learn: we learn more from our failures than from our successes. With success, sure, we are pleased, but we often have no idea why we succeeded. With failure, it is often possible to figure out why, to ensure that it will never happen again
    
-   designers have a special obligation to ensure that the behavior of machines is un- derstandable to the people who interact with them
    
-   True collabo- ration requires each party to make some effort to accommodate and understand the other
    
-   1. What do I want to accomplish? 2. What are the alternative action sequences? 3. What action can I do now? 4. How do I do it? 5. What happened? 6. What does it mean? 7. Is this okay? Have I accomplished my goal?
    
-   Don't criticize unless you can do better
    
-   The information that helps answer questions of execution (do- ing) is feedforward. The information that aids in understanding what has happened is feedback
    
-   Designers should strive to minimize the chance of inappro- priate actions in the first place by using affordances, signifiers, good mapping, and constraints to guide the actions. If a person performs an inappropriate action, the design should maximize the chance that this can be discovered and then rectified. This requires good, intelligible feedback coupled with a simple, clear conceptual model. When people understand what has happened, what state the system is in, and what the most appropriate set of actions is, they can perform their activities more effectively
    
-   Take people's difficulties as signifiers of where the product can be improved
    
-   Machines should judge the quality of information given it
    
-   Think positively, for yourself and for the people you interact with
    
-   When something doesn't work, it can be considered an interesting challenge, or perhaps just a positive learning experience
    
-   It seems natural for people to blame their own misfortunes on the environment. It seems equally natural to blame other people's misfortunes on their personalities. Just the opposite attribution, by the way, is made when things go well. When things go right, peo- ple credit their own abilities and intelligence. The onlookers do the reverse. When they see things go well for someone else, they sometimes credit the environment, or luck
    
-   Human error usually is a result of poor design: it should be called system error
    
-   Good designs fit our needs so well that the design is invisible, serving us without drawing attention to itself
    
-   Two of the most important characteristics of good design are discoverability and understanding. Discoverability: Is it possible to even figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them? Understanding: What does it all mean? How is the product supposed to be used? What do all the different controls and settings mean?
    
-   With complex devices, discoverability and understanding require the aid of manuals or personal instruction. We accept this if the device is indeed complex, but it should be unnecessary for simple things. Many products defy understanding simply because they have too many functions and controls
    
-   This book covers everyday things, focusing on the interplay between technology and people to ensure that the products actually fulfill human needs while being understandable and usable. In the best of cases, the products should also be delightful and enjoyable, which means that not only must the requirements of engineering, manufacturing, and ergonomics be satisfied, but attention must be paid to the entire experience, which means the aesthetics of form and the quality of interaction
    
-   Industrial design: The professional service of creating and developing concepts and specifications that optimize the function, value, and appearance of products and systems for the mutual benefit of both user and manufacturer
    
-   Interaction design: The focus is upon how people interact with technology. The goal is to enhance people's understanding of what can be done, what is happening, and what has just occurred. Interaction design draws upon principles of psychology, design, art, and emotion to ensure a positive, enjoyable experience
    
-   Experience design: The practice of designing products, processes, services, events, and environments with a focus placed on the quality and enjoyment of the total experience
    
-   Design is concerned with how things work, how they are controlled, and the nature of the interaction between people and technology
    
-   We have to accept human behavior the way it is, not the way we would wish it to be
    
-   You are designing for people the way you would like them to be, not for the way they really are
    
-   Even experts make errors. So we must design our machines on the assumption that people will make errors
    
-   The solution is human-centered design (HCD), an approach that puts human needs, capabilities, and behavior first, then designs to accommodate those needs, capabilities, and ways of behaving
    
-   Good design requires good communication, especially from machine to person, indicating what actions are possible, what is happening, and what is about to happen. Communication is especially important when things go wrong. It is relatively easy to design things that work smoothly and harmoniously as long as things go right. But as soon as there is a problem or a misunderstanding, the problems arise. This is where good design is essential. Designers need to focus their attention on the cases where things go wrong, not just on when things work as planned. Actually, this is where the most satisfaction can arise: when something goes wrong but the machine highlights the problems, then the person understands the issue, takes the proper actions, and the problem is solved. When this happens smoothly, the collaboration of person and device feels wonderful
    
-   Human-centered design is a design philosophy. It means starting with a good understanding of people and the needs that the design is intended to meet. This understanding comes about primarily through observation, for people themselves are often unaware of their true needs, even unaware of the difficulties they are encountering
    
-   Great designers produce pleasurable experiences
    
-   Experience is critical, for it determines how fondly people remember their interactions
    
-   When we interact with a product, we need to figure out how to work it. This means discovering what it does, how it works, and what operations are possible: discoverability
    
-   An affordance is a relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could possibly be used
    
-   An affordance is a relationship. Whether an affordance exists depends upon the properties of both the object and the agent
    
-   If an affordance or anti-affordance cannot be perceived, some means of signaling its presence is required: I call this property a signifier
    
-   Affordances exist even if they are not visible. For designers, their visibility is critical: visible affordances provide strong clues to the operations of things
    
-   Perceived affordances help people figure out what actions are possible without the need for labels or instructions. I call the signaling component of affordances signifiers
    
-   Many people find affordances difficult to understand because they are relationships, not properties
    
-   Affordances describe what is possible not what is to be done
    
-   Affordances determine what actions are possible. Signifiers communicate where the action should take place. We need both
    
-   What people need, and what designers must provide, are signifiers. Good design requires, among other things, good communication of the purpose, structure, and operation of the device to the people who use it. That is the role of the signifier
    
-   the term signifier refers to any mark or sound, any perceivable indicator that communicates appropriate behavior to a person
    
-   Signifiers signal things, in particular what actions are possible and how they should be done. Signifiers must be perceivable, else they fail to function
    
-   Profound ideas are always obvious once they are understood
    
-   The relationship between a control and its results is easiest to learn wherever there is an understandable mapping between the controls, the actions, and the intended result
    
-   Natural mapping, by which I mean taking advantage of spatial analogies, leads to immediate understanding
    
-   Related controls should be grouped together. Controls should be close to the item being controlled
    
-   Feedback: some way of letting you know that the system is working on your request
    
-   Feedback must be immediate: even a delay of a tenth of a second can be disconcerting. If the delay is too long, people often give up, going off to do other activities
    
-   A conceptual model is an explanation, usually highly simplified, of how something works. It doesn't have to be complete or even accurate as long as it is useful
    
-   Technology offers the potential to make life easier and more enjoyable; each new technology provides increased benefits
    
-   The hard part is to convince people to understand the viewpoints of the others, to abandon their disciplinary viewpoint and to think of the design from the viewpoints of the person who buys the product and those who use it, often different people
    
-   The challenge is to use the principles of human-centered design to produce positive results, products that enhance lives and add to our pleasure and enjoyment. The goal is to produce a great product, one that is successful, and that customers love. It can be done
    
-   We bridge the Gulf of Execution through the use of signifiers, constraints, mappings, and a conceptual model. We bridge the Gulf of Evaluation through the use of feedback and a conceptual model
    
-   The Seven Stages of the Action Cycle. Putting all the stages together yields the three stages of execution (plan, specify, and perform), three stages of evaluation (perceive, interpret, and compare), and, of course, the goal: seven stages in all
    
-   Because things are designed to be used by people, and without a deep understanding of people, the designs are apt to be faulty, difficult to use, difficult to understand
    
-   Cognition attempts to make sense of the world: emotion assigns value
    
-   A positive emotional state is ideal for creative thought, but it is not very well suited for getting things done
    
-   For designers, the visceral response is about immediate per- ception. Here is where the style matters: appearances, whether sound or sight, touch or smell, drive the visceral response. This has nothing to do with how usable, effective, or understandable the product is. It is all about attraction or repulsion. Great designers use their aesthetic sensibilities to drive these visceral responses
    
-   For designers, the most critical aspect of the behavioral level is that every action is associated with an expectation
    
-   A lack of feedback creates a feeling of lack of con- trol, which can be unsettling. Feedback is critical to managing ex- pectations, and good design provides this. Feedbackâ€”knowledge of resultsâ€”is how expectations are resolved and is critical to learn- ing and the development of skilled behavior
    
-   To the designer, reflection is perhaps the most important of the levels of processing. Reflection is conscious, and the emotions produced at this level are the most protracted: those that assign agency and cause, such as guilt and blame or praise and pride. Re- flective responses are part of our memory of events. Memories last far longer than the immediate experience or the period of usage, which are the domains of the visceral and behavioral levels. It is reflection that drives us to recommend a product, to recommend that others use itâ€”or perhaps to avoid it
    
-   When in the flow state, people lose track of time and the outside environment. They are at one with the task they are performing. The task, moreover, is at just the proper level of difficulty: difficult enough to provide a challenge and require continued atten- tion, but not so difficult that it invokes frustration and anxiety
    
-   We combine knowledge in the head with knowledge in the world
    
-   Knowledge of cultural constraints and conventions exists in the head
    
-   Because not all of the knowledge required for precise behavior has to be in the head. It can be distributedâ€”partly in the head, partly in the world, and partly in the constraints of the world
    
-   Precision, accuracy, and complete- ness of knowledge are seldom required. Perfect behavior results if the combined knowledge in the head and in the world is sufficient to distinguish an appropriate choice from all others
    
-   Whenever knowledge needed to do a task is readily available in the world, the need for us to learn it diminishes
    
-   Information is in the world. Much of the information a person needs to do a task can reside in the world. Behavior is determined by combining the information in memory (in the head) with that in the world
    
-   Perfect behavior will result if the knowledge describes the information or behavior sufficiently to dis- tinguish the correct choice from all others
    
-   The physical properties of objects constrain possible operations: the order in which parts can go together and the ways in which an object can be moved, picked up, or otherwise manipulated
    
-   People function through their use of two kinds of knowledge: knowledge of and knowledge how. Knowledge ofâ€”what psychologists call declarative knowledgeâ€”includes the knowledge of facts and rules. Knowledge howâ€”what psychologists call procedural knowledgeâ€”is the knowledge that enables a person to perform music
    
-   Any problems you have are probably the design's fault, not yours
    
-   The ideal reminder has to have both components: the signal that something is to be remembered, the message of what it is
    
-   Wherever labels seem necessary, consider another design
    
-   Test products before you buy them
    
-   The difficulty of dealing with novel situations is directly related to the number of possibilities
    
-   Affordances suggest the range of possibilities, constraints limit the number of alternatives. The thoughtful use of affordances and constraints together in design lets a user determine readily the proper course of action, even in a novel situation
    
-   Semantic constraints rely upon the meaning of the situation to control the set of possible actions
    
-   Make relevant parts visible
    
-   Give each action an immediate and obvious effect
    
-   The important things to watch should be visible and clearly marked; the results of any action should be immediately apparent
    
-   Natural sound is as essential as visual information because sound tells us about things we can't see, and it does so while our eyes are occupied elsewhere
    
-   Most everyday errors are slips. Intend to do one action, find yourself doing another
    
-   Slips result from a lack of attention
    
-   For every skill, the low-level, physical movements should be controlled subconsciously
    
-   We can place slips into one of six categories: capture errors, description errors, data-driven errors, associative activation errors, loss-of-activation errors, and mode errors
    
-   Consider the common slip called the capture error, in which a fre- quently done activity suddenly takes charge instead of (captures) the one intended
    
-   The capture error appears whenever two different action sequences have their initial stages in common, with one sequence being unfamil- iar and the other being well practiced
    
-   Description errors occur most frequently when the wrong and right objects are physically near each other
    
-   Associative activation errors are the slips studied by Freud; you think something that ought not to be said and then, to your embarrassment, you say it
    
-   If external data can sometimes trigger actions, so, too, can internal thoughts and associations
    
-   Automatic actions are data drivenâ€”triggered by the arrival of the sensory data. But sometimes data-driven activities can intrude into an ongoing action sequence, causing behavior that was not intended
    
-   Mode errors occur when devices have different modes of operation, and the action appropriate for one mode has different meanings in other modes
    
-   Mode errors are inevitable any time equipment is de- signed to have more possible actions than it has controls or displays, so the controls must do double duty
    
-   In computer systems, it is common to prevent errors by requiring confirmation before a command will be executed, especially when the action will destroy a file. But the request is ill timed; it comes just after the person has initiated the action and is still fully content with the choice
    
-   When you build an error-tolerant mechanism, people come to rely upon it, so it had better be reliable
    
-   Mistakes result from the choice of inappropriate goals. A person makes a poor decision, misclassifies a situation, or fails to take all the relevant factors into account
    
-   Warning signals are usually not the answer
    
-   1. Understand the causes of error and design to minimize those causes. 2. Make it possible to reverse actionsâ€”to 'undo' themâ€”or make it harder to do what cannot be reversed. 3. Make it easier to discover the errors that do occur, and make them easier to correct. 4. Change the attitude toward errors. Think of an object's user as attempting to do a task, getting there by imperfect approximations. Don't think of the user as making errors; think of the actions as approximations of what is desired
    
-   Don't punish the person for making errors. Don't take offense. But most of all, don't ignore it. Try to design the system to allow for errors. Realize that normal behavior isn't always accurate. Design so that errors are easy to discover and corrections are possible
    
-   Warnings and safety methods must be used with care and intelligence, taking into account the tradeoffs for the people who are affected
    
-   Forcing functions are a form of physical constraint: situations in which the actions are constrained so that failure at one stage prevents the next step from happening. Example disabling a button
    
-   It isn't easy to force unwanted behavior upon people
    
-   The entire interaction should be treated as a cooperative endeavor between person and machine, one in which mis- conceptions can arise on either side
    
-   Think of the user's point of view. Assume that every possible mishap will happen, so protect against it. Make actions reversible. Try to make them less costly
    
-   Put the required knowledge in the world. Don't require all the knowledge to be in the head. Yet do allow for more efficient opera- tion when the user has learned the operations, has gotten the knowl- edge in the head
    
-   On the execution side, make the options readily available. On the evaluation side, make the results of each action apparent. Make it possible to determine the system state readily, easily, and accurately, and in a form consistent with the person's goals, intentions, and expectations
    
-   Mr. Densmore insisted that this was the very salvation of the enterprise; that it showed the weak spots and defects, and that the machine must be made so that anybody could use it, or all efforts might as well be abandoned; that such a test was a blessing and not a misfor- 1 tune, for which the enterprise should be thankful
    
-   Much good design evolves: the design is tested, problem areas are discovered and modified, and then it is continually retested and remodified until time, energy, and resources run out
    
-   Extra features comes extra complexity
    
-   Complexity probably increases as the square of the features
    
-   Yes, allow features that seem absolutely neces- sary, but steel yourself to the rigors of doing without the rest
    
-   It felt as if you were working directly on the problem, not on a computer
    
-   In each state of the system, the user must readily see and be able to do the allowable actions. The visibility acts as a suggestion, re- minding the user of possibilities and inviting the exploration of new ideas and methods
    
-   The effect of each action must be both visible and easy to interpret. This property allows users to learn the effects of each action, to develop a good mental model of the system, and to learn the causal relationships between actions and outcomes
    
-   Actions should be without cost. When an action has an undesir- able result, it must be readily reversible
    
-   In the case of an irreversible action, the system should make clear what effect the contemplated action will have prior to its execution; there should be enough time to cancel the plan. Or the action should be difficult to do, nonexplorable. Most actions should be cost-free, explorable, discoverable
    
-   The point cannot be overstressed: make the computer system invisible. This principle can be applied with any form of system interaction, direct or indirect

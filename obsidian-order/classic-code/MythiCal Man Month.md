# Mythical Man Month
## Frederick P Brooks

### Patrick Klein Notes
-   The man-month as a unit for measuring the size of a job is a dangerous and deceptive myth
    
-   Each worker must be trained in the technology, the goals of the effort, the overall strategy, and the plan of work
    
-   Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.
    
-   conceptual integrity is the most important consideration in system design.
    
-   Where architecture tells what happens, implementation tells how it is made to happen.
    
-   There is nothing in this world constant but inconstancy
    
-   It is common sense to take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly and try another. But above all, try something

# Mythical Man Month
## Frederick P Brooks

### Patrick Klein Notes
-   The man-month as a unit for measuring the size of a job is a dangerous and deceptive myth
    
-   Each worker must be trained in the technology, the goals of the effort, the overall strategy, and the plan of work
    
-   Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.
    
-   conceptual integrity is the most important consideration in system design.
    
-   Where architecture tells what happens, implementation tells how it is made to happen.
    
-   There is nothing in this world constant but inconstancy
    
-   It is common sense to take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly and try another. But above all, try something

_“First, one must perform perfectly. The computer resembles the magic of legend in this respect, too. If one character, one pause, of the incantation is not strictly in proper form, the magic doesn’t work.”_

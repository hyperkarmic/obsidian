# Stacks - Queues and Decques
## Stacks, Queues, and Deques

Occasionally they are also called **pseudo data structures**, as they don't require a strict ordering such as continuous blocks of memory in an **array** or the pointer structure of a **linked list**.

**Stacks**, **Queues**, and **Deques** can be implemented using both **arrays** and **linked lists**. The only mandate is following the **LIFO**, **FIFO**, and **Deque paradigms** (even though the **linked list** is more optimized for the implementation than **arrays**).

Having some practical experience with these **data structures** will suffice for most cases.

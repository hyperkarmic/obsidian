# Hashing
## Hash Maps and Hash Lists

**Hash Maps** are probably the most used data structure on the planet, after **arrays**. They are widely used for efficient searches. From **JavaScript Objects** to **Python dictionaries**, they are everywhere.

The use of **Hash Lists** isn't that common, but they too have niche applications. In most languages, they are known as **Sets**.

Knowledge of **hashing algorithms** is not required, to use them, but it does get you extra brownie points. For these too, you can get away with some basic hands-on knowledge.

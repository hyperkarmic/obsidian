## Trees

**Trees** are quite useful **data structures**, especially while storing hierarchical data.

There are specific types of **trees**, that are commonly used:

1.  **Binary Trees**: A **binary tree** is a tree in which each node has at most two children.
2.  **Binary Search Trees**: A **binary search tree** is a **binary tree** in which all the nodes are arranged in such a way that the left subtree of a node only contains nodes with keys less than the node's key, and the right subtree contains nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
3.  **Trie**: A **trie**, also known as **prefix tree**, is a tree data structure that is typically used to preprocess a set of strings.

For **trees**, you should learn the **traversals**, **searches**, and **node insertions**.

Knowledge of generic **trees** is rarely required, though if you are a web developer, it would be a great asset in your arsenal. It would help you understand how the **DOM** operates and even create complex nested **UI** programmatically, without hardcoding it.

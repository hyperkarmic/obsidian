# memoization
**Memoization** is a specific form of caching used in dynamic programming. **Caching** is a way to speed our programs and hold some data in an accessible box for later use. It stores the pre-computed value and returns the value instantaneously if the given input is seen before.
***
Memoization is a programming technique that attempts to increase a function’s performance by caching its previously computed results. As JavaScript objects behave like associative arrays, they are ideal candidates to act as caches. Each time a memoized function is called, its parameters are used to index the cache. If the data is present, then it can be returned, without executing the entire function. However, if the data is not cached, then the function is executed, and the result is added to the cache.

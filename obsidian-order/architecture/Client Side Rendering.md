# Definition

CSR is a method of rendering a web page or application on the client side, typically in the user’s web browser, as opposed to on the server side. This allows for more dynamic and interactive user experiences, as well as faster initial loading times, since only the necessary data is sent to the client. JavaScript libraries and frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue.js are often used to implement CSR.

# Usage

Besides CSR there are also other techniques for rendering web sites, such as server-side rendering (SSR) or static rendering. The choice between CSR and other techniques depends on the specific requirements of the application and should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. But in general CSR are most used for the following use cases:

-   When building a Single-page application (**SPA**), where the majority of the content is dynamic and updates in real-time, CSR is often the preferred choice as it allows for fast and seamless updates to the user interface.
-   CSR is ideal for building applications that require a lot of user interaction and **real-time** updates, as it provides a smoother and more responsive user experience.
-   When building resource-intensive applications that require high performance and **scalability**, CSR can offload some of the processing to the client, reducing the load on the server and improving overall performance.
-   CSR is browser-agnostic and can run on multiple modern platforms, making it a good choice for building applications that need to run on a **variety** of devices and platforms. You have to be careful about older browsers though.
-   For applications that need to respond quickly to user inputs, CSR can provide a **faster** and more responsive experience as the processing is done on the client side.

# Advantages

Looking at the use cases, it’s clear that CSR offers many advantages, such as:

-   As the browser can process JavaScript faster, the user can interact with the dynamic content faster, leading to a better **UX**.
-   By offloading some of the rendering to the client, the **server** is relieved from the rendering burden, which can result in improved server performance and reduced server load.
-   With CSR, the developers have more control over the **SEO** aspects as the content is generated on the client-side and can be optimized for search engines.
-   CSR enables the development of **offline**-capable applications that can continue to function even without a network connection.
-   The **reusable** components developed using CSR can be easily shared across multiple projects, leading to increased development efficiency.

# Disadvantages

Despite these advantages, there are also disadvantages you have to keep in mind:

-   Different browsers may have different levels of JavaScript support and processing capabilities, leading to **compatibility** issues with some older browsers.
-   Although CSR provides more control over **SEO**, search engines may not be able to crawl and index the dynamically generated content properly, leading to decreased visibility.
-   CSR increases the attack surface area as it requires the execution of untrusted JavaScript code on the client-side, increasing the risk of **security** vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS).
-   As the processing burden shifts from the server to the client, the client’s **performance** can become a bottleneck, especially for resource-intensive applications.

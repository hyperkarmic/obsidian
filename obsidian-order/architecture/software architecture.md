#  software architecture - definition

Software architecture describes the fundamental concepts and properties of a system within the context of its environment, relationships, principles of design, and more. Software architecture encompasses the organization of a software system, structural elements, behavioral elements, and the composition of those elements into larger subsystems. Software systems can often contain multiple architectures.

***
To extend Danny Thorpe’s cave analogy, having a cave system thoroughly mapped out can make a huge difference if, say, your spelunking trip has gone awry and you’re waiting for rescuers to find you.

Similarly, thorough software architecture can help your engineers quickly locate and fix bugs.

Good software architecture diagrams are sources of truth and clarity. You want your diagram to quickly convey a software system’s essential composition and behaviors to both technical and non-technical audiences.

High-level architectural diagrams and thorough documentation can be effective tools for communicating the internal state of a system or application when done well.

Diagramming before you start coding and diagramming after your code has been written will also confer different benefits.

-   **Forward design** entails creating your diagrams **before** you or your team starts coding. This has the benefit of helping your developers better visualize the system they’re trying to create.
-   **Backward design** involves diagramming **after** the code has already been written. This can help developers see how the project developed and document that workflow to improve later.

***

A good architectural diagram will:

-   Diagram core components
-   Highlight critical system interactions and relationships
-   Be easy to access and share
-   Maintain a consistent style
-   Make it easier to identify potential flaws or areas for improvement in the software architecture

You also want your diagram to be as self-explanatory as possible so that anyone looking at it can immediately see the relationships, constraints, and limitations in your software system without needing to ask you what something means.

A good architectural diagram will:

-   Diagram core components
-   Highlight critical system interactions and relationships
-   Be easy to access and share
-   Maintain a consistent style

#  software architecture - definition

Software architecture describes the fundamental concepts and properties of a system within the context of its environment, relationships, principles of design, and more. Software architecture encompasses the organization of a software system, structural elements, behavioral elements, and the composition of those elements into larger subsystems. Software systems can often contain multiple architectures.

> _“Programming without an overall architecture or design in mind is like exploring a cave with only a flashlight: You don’t know where you’ve been, you don’t know where you’re going, and you don’t know quite where you are.”_

***
To extend Danny Thorpe’s cave analogy, having a cave system thoroughly mapped out can make a huge difference if, say, your spelunking trip has gone awry and you’re waiting for rescuers to find you.

Similarly, thorough software architecture can help your engineers quickly locate and fix bugs.

Good software architecture diagrams are sources of truth and clarity. You want your diagram to quickly convey a software system’s essential composition and behaviors to both technical and non-technical audiences.

High-level architectural diagrams and thorough documentation can be effective tools for communicating the internal state of a system or application when done well.

Diagramming before you start coding and diagramming after your code has been written will also confer different benefits.

-   **Forward design** entails creating your diagrams **before** you or your team starts coding. This has the benefit of helping your developers better visualize the system they’re trying to create.
-   **Backward design** involves diagramming **after** the code has already been written. This can help developers see how the project developed and document that workflow to improve later.

***

A good architectural diagram will:

-   Diagram core components
-   Highlight critical system interactions and relationships
-   Be easy to access and share
-   Maintain a consistent style
-   Make it easier to identify potential flaws or areas for improvement in the software architecture

You also want your diagram to be as self-explanatory as possible so that anyone looking at it can immediately see the relationships, constraints, and limitations in your software system without needing to ask you what something means.

A good architectural diagram will:

-   Diagram core components
-   Highlight critical system interactions and relationships
-   Be easy to access and share
-   Maintain a consistent style
-   Make it easier to identify potential flaws or areas for improvement in the software architecture

_Software architecture_ is the body of instructions, written in a specific coding language, which controls the structure and interactions of the system modules. The properties of capacity, throughput, consistency and module compatibility are fixed at the architectural level.  
The processing architecture is code that governs how the processing modules work together to do the system functions. The communication architecture is code that governs the interactions of the processing modules with the data and with other systems. The data architecture is code that controls how the data files are structured, filled with data and accessed. Once the architecture is established, functions may be assigned to processing modules and the system may be built. Processing modules can vary greatly in size, scope, depending on the function each performs, and the same module may differ across installations. In every case, however, the processing architecture, communication architecture and data architecture constitute the software architecture that is the system’s unique and unchanging “fingerprint.” Therefore, when systems share a common architecture, they are the same, regardless of superficial differences in various installations.  
When several sites use software systems with a common architecture, they are considered to be using the same software system even though they may do somewhat different things. No two iterations of a software system are exactly the same, despite their shared architecture. When a system is installed at two or more sites, localization is always required. Tables are populated with data to configure the software to meet the needs of specific customer sites. The customer may have special needs that require more than minor table adjustments. Customization of some modules may be required. New modules may be added.  
Alternatively, two systems with differing architectures can perform the same function in alternative ways. These would be different systems. Function and output do not define a system. Only its architecture can describe and identify a system.

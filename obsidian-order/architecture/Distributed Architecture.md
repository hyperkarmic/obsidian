Distributed architecture refers to the design and implementation of software systems that are composed of multiple interconnected components or nodes, running on different machines or servers, and communicating with each other over a network.

This approach allows for the creation of **highly scalable**, **fault-tolerant**, and **flexible** applications that can handle large volumes of traffic and support a wide range of use cases. Node.js, a popular server-side JavaScript runtime, is a great tool for building distributed architectures, thanks to its asynchronous, event-driven programming model, lightweight and modular architecture, and extensive ecosystem of third-party modules and tools.

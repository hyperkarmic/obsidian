# JEST
Jest is a **Javascript testing library** developed by Facebook in 2011 when they switched their chat feature over to javascript and the added complexity pushed Facebook to increase the efficiency of their test-driven development cycle. However, in more recent times they have been transferred from MetaOpen Source to the OpenJS Foundation.

# **Benefits/features of Jest**

## **Excellent documentation**

Much like how I mentioned the react documentation in my previous article: [_Two must use hooks_](https://medium.com/@samhcarrasco/react-two-must-use-hooks-64ef32d57dfc) the documentation for Jest is ridiculously good. From its origin to its setup and clear code examples. It’s all there please check them out after reading this article to gain a deeper understanding of implementing tests for your specific project.

## **Support for mock data**

Jest allows you to test many things using mock data right out of the box. Specifically, you can mock node modules, API responses, and even react components.

## **Jest supports snapshot testing**

Snapshot testing essentially allows you to create an instance or snapshot of a react component and when the test runs it will compare the current state of that component to the snapshot. If the component changes then it’s an indication for you to either rewrite the code or rerun the snapshot.

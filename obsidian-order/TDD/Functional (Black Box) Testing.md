Functional testing, also known as black-box testing, is a type of software testing that focuses on testing the functionality of a system or application. It is designed to test the systemâ€™s end-to-end functionality, including the inputs, processes, and outputs of the system, to ensure that the system behaves as expected.
***
Functional testing is typically done by creating test cases that cover the different functional requirements of the system, such as user scenarios, workflows, and business processes. These test cases are then executed against the system, and the results are compared to the expected outcomes.

Functional testing can be done manually by testing engineers, or it can be automated using functional testing tools. Automated functional testing is often preferred because it is more efficient and less prone to human error.

Some popular tools for automated functional tests include:

-   Jest: A JavaScript testing framework developed by Facebook
-   Mocha: A JavaScript test framework that runs on Node.js and the browser
-   Cypress: An end-to-end testing framework for web applications
-   TestCafe: A Node.js tool to automate end-to-end web testing.

Functional testing is a crucial step in the software development process because it helps to ensure that the system behaves as intended and meets the requirements of the users. By identifying defects early in the development process, functional testing can help to reduce the overall cost of development and improve the quality of the final product.

Functional testing can be done on different levels such as unit, integration, and acceptance level. At the unit level, functional testing is used to test individual functions or methods of the code. At integration level, it is used to test how different units of the code work together and at acceptance level, it is used to test the whole system as a whole, to check whether it is fulfilling the requirements or not.

Functional testing in JavaScript typically involves writing test cases that exercise the functionality of the system or application, and then executing those test cases using a testing framework.

Functional testing in JavaScript typically involves writing test cases that exercise the functionality of the system or application, and then executing those test cases using a testing framework such as Jest, Mocha, Selenium, Cypress, or TestCafe. These frameworks provide the necessary functionality to write, run, and report on test cases, making it easier to ensure that the application behaves as expected.

# TDD - definition
TDD:[Test-Driven Development](https://semaphoreci.com/blog/test-driven-development)Â (TDD) is a software design practice in which a developer writes tests before code. By inverting the usual order in which software is written, a developer can think of a problem in terms of inputs and outputs and write more testable (and thus more modular) code.

The TDD cycle consists of three steps:

1.  **Red**: write a test that fails.
    
2.  **Green**: write the minimal code that passes the test.
    
3.  **Refactor**: improve the code, and make it more abstract, readable, and optimized.

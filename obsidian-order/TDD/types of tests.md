# types of tests
Types Of Tests:**Unit tests**: validate that functions or classes behave as expected.

-   **Integration tests**: are used to verify that the different components of an application work well together.
    
-   **End-to-end tests**: check an application by simulating user interaction.
    
-   **Static tests**: finds defects in code without actually executing it.
    
-   **Security tests**: scans the applicationâ€™s dependencies for known security issues.
    
-   **[Smoke tests](https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/smoke-testing)**: fast tests that check if the application can start and that the infrastructure is ready to accept deployments.

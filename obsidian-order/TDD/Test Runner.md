A test runner is a tool that is responsible for running and executing tests. It is used to automate the process of running tests, making it easier to execute tests and view the results. In the context of unit testing, a test runner is a program that runs the unit tests and provides feedback on the results, such as whether the tests passed or failed.

Test runners can be integrated with your development environment, so that tests can be run automatically as soon as you save changes to your code.

Test runners typically provide a way to run all tests at once, or to run a specific test or set of tests. They also provide a way to view the results of the tests, such as a list of passing and failing tests, and often include additional features such as code coverage and performance metrics.

Test runners can also be configured to run tests automatically whenever certain events occur, such as when code is committed to a version control system, or when code is pushed to a production environment.

A test runner is a tool that is responsible for running and executing tests. It is used to automate the process of running tests, making it easier to execute tests and view the results. In the context of unit testing, a test runner is a program that runs the unit tests and provides feedback on the results, such as whether the tests passed or failed.

Test runners can be integrated with your development environment, so that tests can be run automatically as soon as you save changes to your code.

Test runners typically provide a way to run all tests at once, or to run a specific test or set of tests. They also provide a way to view the results of the tests, such as a list of passing and failing tests, and often include additional features such as code coverage and performance metrics.

Test runners can also be configured to run tests automatically whenever certain events occur, such as when code is committed to a version control system, or when code is pushed to a production environment.

# Test Runner

A test runner is a tool that executes automated tests written for a software application and reports the results to the user. It provides an environment to run the tests and collect the test results. Test runners can be configured to run different types of tests, such as unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

So basically, a test runner can schedule and run tests in parallel, ensuring the setup and teardown functions are called at the right time, etc. Also, you can configure them only to run a small subset of your tests â€” which is helpful for a larger project containing thousands of tests.

Some famous test runners for JavaScript and React applications include Jest, Mocha, and Cypress.

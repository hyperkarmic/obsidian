Docker: is like a small operating system that you install your stuff on. You might think it is annoying to have an operating system inside your operating system but this small operating system is a system you can give to someone else and they will be able to run it exactly like you. It’s reproducible and packaged up in one chunk. Take that idea one step further and we get to kubernetes.

Docker:  Docker is a containerization platform that solves the libraries and dependency issues once and for all. As the tester and developer now have the same system running on Docker container, they both are able to run the application in the Docker environment without having to face differences in dependencies issues as before.

In simple terms, you can now wrap up all the pieces your software needs in a single unit called a docker image, then ship or share this image with anyone. And, as long as the recipient has Docker, they will be able to run or test your project. Gone are the days of, “But it worked on my machine!”

**Docker** is one of the most popular container technologies. It provides developers with an abstraction layer that allows them to package their application in a container, which can then be deployed on any Docker-compatible infrastructure.

**Docker** allows you to quickly deploy your application with all of its dependencies in one shot while also providing process isolation. Similarly, Kubernetes, a container orchestration tool, takes it a step further by managing containers for you.

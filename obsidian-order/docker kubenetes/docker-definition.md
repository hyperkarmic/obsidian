# docker
Docker: is like a small operating system that you install your stuff on. You might think it is annoying to have an operating system inside your operating system but this small operating system is a system you can give to someone else and they will be able to run it exactly like you. Itâ€™s reproducible and packaged up in one chunk. Take that idea one step further and we get to kubernetes.

#docker
#definition

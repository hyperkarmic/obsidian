# container
****Container:**** ****Container**** refers to a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package of a piece of software that allows a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. By doing so, thanks to the container, the developer can rest assured that the application will run on any other Linux machine regardless of any customized settings that the machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code.

In a way, Docker is a bit like a virtual machine. But unlike a virtual machine, rather than creating a whole virtual operating system, Docker allows applications to use the same Linux kernel as the system that they’re running on and only requires applications to be shipped with things not already running on the host computer. Also, containers are created and booted in seconds, use fewer resources while a VM takes time to boot and use more resources.

**Containers** have been used by developers for a long time to build, ship, and run applications.

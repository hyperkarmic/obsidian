****Kubermetes:******In kubernetes** __(or spelled k8s, because that is way cooler!)__ **we don’t have a single container, but a fleet of containers to build our applications. For instance: a database, a load balancer, the code that runs a website and maybe even your R container that runs your prediction code combined can become an e-commerce site.**

***
**Kubernetes** is an open-source container management system. It includes mechanisms for deploying containers across multiple hosts as well as controlling how they communicate with one another. This means you don’t have to worry about your application’s scalability because Kubernetes or K8s can handle it for you automatically.

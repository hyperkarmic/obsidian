# kubernetes definition
****Kubermetes:******In kubernetes** __(or spelled k8s, because that is way cooler!)__ **we don’t have a single container, but a fleet of containers to build our applications. For instance: a database, a load balancer, the code that runs a website and maybe even your R container that runs your prediction code combined can become an e-commerce site.**

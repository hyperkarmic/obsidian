# sr vs jr
# Senior Developer:

1.  When you read a code made by a senior, you should understand what it does without having to read comments. The code should be simple.
2.  An excellent senior programmer puts his ego aside and doesn’t use complex processes just for looks during code review. Moreover, code review is used for a senior programmer to find problems and find better ways of doing things.
3.  Senior developers are always thinking about the future of their programs. So when they read a specification, they can understand exactly how a feature should be implemented so that it fits together harmoniously with the rest of the program (modular programming). As a result, we can easily modify it or even predict future needs around this functionality.
4.  The algorithms used by the senior developer will generally be more straightforward than those implemented by the junior developer.
5.  The senior will have a simple solution to solve a complex problem.
6.  The code of an experienced developer is better organized and commented. There will be comments explaining his choices and working methods. This makes a huge difference in maintaining the code after several years.
7.  Code from an experienced developer follows best practices and is easy to read.
8.  The senior produces short methods that can be reused. It also splits the code into logical layers to organize the code and thus be able to grow the codebase without always being lost.

# Junior Developer:

1.  A junior uses numbers and codes as values, which mean nothing. The senior uses constants and enumerations to name values ​​to make sense of them.
2.  The indentation of the lines is an important point that differentiates an amateur who does not give a damn about his work from a professional who cares about the quality he delivers.
3.  A junior’s comments are written to describe what the code does. This kind of comment is unnecessary by contributing nothing more to understanding the code.
4.  The junior writes long methods that cannot be reused, which results in a lot of copying and pasting of the same lines. This increases the complexity of maintenance and the likelihood of bugs occurring.
5.  The junior developers will tend to get straight to the point. Typically, he will read the specifications, understand the work he has to do, then code everything without even taking the time to design what he is about to develop.
6.  A junior’s comments are written to describe what the code does. This kind of comment is unnecessary by contributing nothing more to understanding the code.
7.  The junior often has a complex solution to solve a simple problem.
8.  Poor overall project or business structure structuring makes the code less maintainable or even complex modifications.
9.  The use of megastructures and unnecessary sorting, or multiple calls to unmeasured external resources, mar the performance.
10.  Hyper classic bugs linked to encoding, to the data size limit, to concurrent accesses not imagined but very real, within reach, bad initializations (no value at the right time)

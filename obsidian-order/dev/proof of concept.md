# proof of concept

A Proof of Concept (PoC) is basically a stand-alone project that covers a very small scope and is quickly developed or hacked together so that it can test assumptions. Using the scientific method, you devise experiments to test your hypothesis. This can be accomplished in a multitude of ways such as stand alone codebases, web pages, user workflow diagrams, or even spreadsheets with macros. Iâ€™ve seen great functional ones built on FileMaker Pro that also served as a Prototype. There are even applications made for this phase. Regardless of which tool you use, you should always know up front what you want to learn and how to measure success or failure. This ultimately guides whether or not to continue investing in this approach or try something new.

There are two goals during the testing of the PoC, to test assumptions and to share the vision. Either you fail quickly and learn from it or you learn that you proved the concept and are now ready to share the vision.
***
PoCs are ideal for new projects and major features. New features can include user interface design and workflows. You can test this by creating mockups of the interface and get user feedback. This is commonly skipped and much development time is wasted in integrating untested user interfaces
***
The key in developing a PoC is to use the tools you know and focus on the easiest way to get it done quickly.
***
The PoC typically has the smallest scope and has limited usability but is crucial in testing assumptions with minimal investment. Be prepared to start over a few times and introduce a lot of change because there is the most to be learned here.

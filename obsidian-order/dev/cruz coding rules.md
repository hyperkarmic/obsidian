# Cruz's coding rules

There are man principles we follow in the programming world. Some are widespread knowledge but some are often not said because it’s from personal experiences, such as:

1.  **Never start programming without having a solid idea of ​​what you’re going to do.** This goes for the most diverse projects and even the most straightforward programs. Going out coding without a specific direction will often result in rework.
2.  **Simple is better than complex.** Not only you but other people must understand what has been done. Never despise comments.
3.  **If you are working on a moderately sized project and have the needed resources, consider using MVC architecture.** Separating the various files in your project properly makes development more straightforward.
4.  **As tempting as it is to create your functions for complex things like calculations, using your library for this is more than worth it.** Remember that you often won’t have time to code something from scratch and that many libraries are made by people and organizations that are subject matter experts.
5.  **Divide and conquer.** If you have a big problem, break it down into smaller parts and solve them. This facilitates/improves your understanding of the problem and makes it easier to solve. This is also a fundamental algorithm-building technique.
6.  **Reuse, and decouple whenever you can.** Write functions/classes/codes that can be reused and generic (to the extent of common sense and the requirements of the problem). Do the same, reuse other people’s codes/solutions. It saves you time now or in the future.
7.  **Write code for people, not machines.** Don’t write code that tomorrow you won’t understand or someone else wouldn’t understand. You are not a better programmer for writing code that only you know (in my opinion, the opposite is true). Write code so people can understand.

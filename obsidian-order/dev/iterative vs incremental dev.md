# interative vs incremental dev
# What are the differences between iterative and incremental development?

I hope that the visual illustrations above are helpful in driving the salient points home. Letâ€™s enumerate the differences:

-   Unlike iterative development, which starts with the whole picture (the whole system), incremental development starts from one fixed part of the system
-   Unlike iterative development, which outlines the whole system in very crude strokes, incremental development works on an isolated fixed part of the system until is fully done (following the Definition of Done, or DoD)
-   Unlike iterative development, which is based on relentless rework, incremental development forbids rework, and only moves on to work on the next part of the system once the previous part is fully fleshed out and frozen for any further changes

# Wireframe
A visual guide to show the **structure** and **content of a web page** without any design elements. This helps to focus on the **layout of content** and **hierarchy**, without being **distracted by design**

#### Wireframing

Wireframing in UX design refers to an illustration or diagram of a website, software, or app page that looks at:

-   The allocation of space on that page
-   The distribution of images and content
-   How content is prioritized
-   What functions are available
-   What behavior is intended and accommodated.

Wireframes rarely contain color, images, or styling because their job is to help the UX team understand and establish relationships among a website’s different templates. These templates need to be determined before any aesthetic considerations are taken into account. By focusing first on the navigation and structure of the site or product, a UX designer is far less likely to become distracted by the visual layer.

Wireframes can be as simple as a **pencil sketch on a piece of paper**, which you could later digitize to **create a prototype** or to add more detailed specifications.

#### Why Do We Use Wireframes As Part Of The UX Design Process?

**We use wireframes to connect the visual design of the site to its information architecture.** The process of wireframing helps us uncover different methods for representing or displaying different types of content and information as well as prioritizing that content in order of importance to the user, their expectations, and their goals. Wireframing helps a UX designer decide on the main functionality for that page and prepare the UX team for prototyping.

**Wireframes are also quick, cheap, and simple to execute.** Create them as early in the process as you can and iterate often. Wireframes are a great way to get an idea across for your team or to discuss with developers.

Here’s a tip from [UXBeginner](http://www.uxbeginner.com/):

> _“If you’re stuck on a design, start with the content. You’ll be surprised how much thinking you can accomplish by just writing or starting your design with some text.”_ [[More info on this topic from UXBeginner here](http://www.uxbeginner.com/the-text-first-ux-portfolio/).]

Wireframing is a practice used by [UX designers](https://careerfoundry.com/en/courses/become-a-ux-designer/) which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product. This process focuses on how the designer or client wants the user to process information on a site, based on the [user research](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/how-to-conduct-user-experience-research-like-a-professional/) already performed by the UX design team.

Wireframing is also a great way of getting to know how a user interacts with your interface, through the positioning of buttons and menus on the diagrams.

Without the distractions of colors, typeface choices or text, wireframing lets you plan the layout and interaction of your interface. A commonly-used argument for wireframing is that if a user doesn’t know where to go on a plain hand-drawn diagram of your site page, then it is irrelevant what colors or fancy text eventually get used. A button or call to action needs to be clear to the user even it’s not brightly colored and flashing.

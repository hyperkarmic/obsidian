“Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.” - Steve Jobs

Friend of CareerFoundry and UX designer [Alex Shirazi](http://www.phlint.com/) told us:

> _“A lot of designers think about the design process as a linear process. However, it should be treated as a dynamic process. For example; Idea, Wireframes, Mockups, Prototypes, then Assets. It’s important to have user tests at each interval of this process if the resources are available.”_

> “When the point of contact between the product and the people becomes a point of friction, then the [designer] has failed. On the other hand, if people are made safer, more comfortable, more eager to purchase, more efficient—or just plain happier—by contact with the product, then the designer has succeeded.”  
> **— Henry Dreyfuss, Industrial Engineer**

Jared Spool, once said: “Good design, when it’s done well, becomes invisible. It’s only when it’s done poorly that we notice it.”
***
> “Everyone can — and does — design. We all design when we plan for something new to happen, whether that might be a new version of a recipe, a new arrangement of the living room furniture, or a new lay tour of a personal web page. […] So design thinking is something inherent within human cognition; it is a key part of what makes us human.” - Nigel Cross

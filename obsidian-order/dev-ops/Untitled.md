### CALMS (Culture, Automation, Lean, Measurement, Sharing)

CALMS is a framework explored in [The DevOps Handbook](https://www.amazon.com.au/Devops-Handbook-World-Class-Reliability-Organizations/dp/1950508404/ref=sr_1_1?crid=22X11LJN7ZYVQ&keywords=the+devops+handbook&qid=1643682944&sprefix=the+devops+handbook%2Caps%2C265&sr=8-1).

CALMS is an acronym where each letter describes the actions needed to adopt DevOps:

-   **Culture** - Remove silos and share responsibility.
-   **Automation** - Reduce time spent on manual tasks.
-   **Lean** - Streamline processes to reduce wasted time.
-   **Measurement** - Collect and review data to find areas for improvement.
-   **Sharing** - Open and honest collaboration between teams.

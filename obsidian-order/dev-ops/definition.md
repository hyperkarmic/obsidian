dev-ops:“DevOps is basically a collection of cultural concepts, methods, and technologies that help in boosting a team’s capacity to provide software and services at a quick speed while maintaining customer satisfaction.”

Dev-Ops:“DevOps fundamentally pulls together two huge siloed teams to enable faster software releases.”

2013 was relatively late to the game in DevOps. If you ask most people about the origin of the term, the two pivotal moments everyone seems to agree on are Patrick Debois and Andrew Clay Shafer meeting at the Agile Conference in Toronto, and the talk by [John Allspaw and Paul Hammond at Velocity ‘09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdOe18KhtT4)

The ideas back then were simple: fix the culture. Since then, the term has taken on a life of its own. We now have “DevOps Engineer” as a job title.

##### **DevOps is about people on the operations side of the fence trying to convince Developers to do things their way**

You want to stand out in a sea of bootcamp grads? Explain how you deployed to AWS using Docker containers and Kubernetes orchestration to handle scale. Explain how you setup git webhooks for notifications in slack for code reviews and commits. Explain how you configured cloudflare to handle caching globally for your site and how specifically it improved your performance. Explain how you have used Gitlab, Bitbucket, and Github for deployment and you know how to use Circle CI, TeamCity too. Explain how you originally had deployed to Heroku, but then deployed to Firebase, and then containerized it and used GKE to deploy it on GCP. The best code in the world is useless if it doesn’t make it production. Localhost is not a solution, it is a playpen for junior devs to build things. Graduate to real deployment strategies and you will be leaps and bounds ahead of ANY bootcamp grad I have ever met.

Devops is primarily associated with the collaboration between developers and operations to improve the delivery and reliability of applications in production. The most common best practices aim to replace manual, error-prone procedures managed at the boundaries between dev and ops teams with more robust automations. These include [automating the delivery pipeline with CI/CD](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3271126/what-is-cicd-continuous-integration-and-continuous-delivery-explained.html) (continuous integration and continuous delivery), standardizing configurations with containers, and configuring infrastructure as code. On the ops side, [devops best practices to improve application reliability](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3613155/5-devops-practices-to-improve-application-reliability.html) include improving apps’ observability, increasing monitoring, and automating cloud and infrastructure operations.

### The Best DevOps Definition

DevOps is a bridge between Development and Operations that lets the teams reach continuous software integration and delivery. There are many approaches and ways to describe this culture, but we insist on sticking to the basics. So, what is the most accurate definition of DevOps? Unsurprisingly, it is given by GitLab: “… A software engineering methodology which aims to integrate the work of software development and software operations teams by facilitating a culture of collaboration and shared responsibility.”

**What Is DevOps?**

DevOps is a collection of practices that bring software development and IT operations together. It focuses on contacting the system’s development life cycle and ensures that software is delivered in a timely and high-quality manner. Several DevOps aspects come in tandem with Agile Software Development.

DevOps brings together formerly disparate tasks (development, IT operations, quality engineering, and security) to **synchronize** and create **more reliable products.**

‘To synchronize here means to collaborate and coordinate as a team to produce better and more well-founded products.’

## What Is DevOps?  

DevOps is an engineering culture that focuses on integrating development and operations together for more efficient development. The term "DevOps" refers to organizational collaboration rather than a framework or standard. To achieve continuous integration and deployment, the various stages of the DevOps life cycle are concentrated on continuously monitoring, operating, implementing, and responding to end-user feedback.

DevOps lifecycle consists of 8 processes that include:

**1. Planning:** Before working on a project, plan, track, visualize, and summarize it.

**2. Coding:** Developers use version control platforms like Git, Github, and Gitlab to write their code.

**3. Building:** Developers use tools like Kubernetes, Docker, Maven, Gradle, and Apache to create a pre-release version that is recognized by a build number rather than a release number.

**4. Testing:** The QA team runs the new piece of code through testing to find and resolve bugs.

**5. Release:** In this step, the built process is planned, scheduled, and controlled in a new setting.

**6. Deploy:** During this stage, the deployment procedure is ongoing. It is done in a way that any modifications made to the code at any point shouldn't have an impact on how a busy website operates.

**7. Operate:** The product or application is supplied to the customer for usage after it has been deployed, where he can utilize it for his everyday needs.

**8. Monitor:** The operation team will address any improper system behavior or problems discovered in production during this period.

### Advantages of DevOps

-   **Faster Delivery** - DevOps principles are always known for faster iteration and standardized processes that make them readily available in the market
-   **Breaking down silos** - DevOps has replaced the antiquated linear process in which one team would finish all responsibilities related to a project before handing it off to another team to continue working on it, and so on.
-   **Software quality** - Because DevOps facilitates frequent releases, it's easier to discover and fix problems which in turn results in higher software stability. Because of this, there is more time to concentrate on quality and innovations.

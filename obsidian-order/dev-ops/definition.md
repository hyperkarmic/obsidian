dev-ops:“DevOps is basically a collection of cultural concepts, methods, and technologies that help in boosting a team’s capacity to provide software and services at a quick speed while maintaining customer satisfaction.”

Dev-Ops:“DevOps fundamentally pulls together two huge siloed teams to enable faster software releases.”

2013 was relatively late to the game in DevOps. If you ask most people about the origin of the term, the two pivotal moments everyone seems to agree on are Patrick Debois and Andrew Clay Shafer meeting at the Agile Conference in Toronto, and the talk by [John Allspaw and Paul Hammond at Velocity ‘09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdOe18KhtT4)

The ideas back then were simple: fix the culture. Since then, the term has taken on a life of its own. We now have “DevOps Engineer” as a job title.

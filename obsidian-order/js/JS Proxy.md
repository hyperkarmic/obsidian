### Q: What is a proxy in JavaScript?

**A**: A proxy is an object that intercepts operations performed on another object, allowing you to modify or control the behavior of that object.

### Q: How do you create a proxy in JavaScript?

**A**: You can create a proxy using the built-in Proxy constructor function, which takes two arguments: the target object to proxy and a handler object that defines the behavior of the proxy.

### Q: What are the common use cases for proxies in JavaScript?

**A**: Proxies are commonly used for data validation, logging, caching, and security. They can also be used to implement features like virtual properties, lazy loading, and transparent interception.

### Q: Can proxies be used to add new properties or methods to an object?

**A**: Yes, proxies can be used to intercept property access and method calls and provide custom behavior, including adding new properties or methods to the target object.

### Q: How do you define custom behavior for a proxy?

**A**: Custom behavior for a proxy is defined by providing a handler object to the Proxy constructor. The handler object can define traps for various operations, such as property access, method invocation, and object enumeration.

### Q: Can proxies be used in older versions of JavaScript?

**A**: No, proxies are a relatively new feature of JavaScript and are only available in ECMAScript 6 and later versions.

# FIRST CLASS FUNCTIONS/CITIZENS
Javascript Functions are First Class Functions, also called First-Class Citizens. This means they can be handled just like any other variable.

This means you can **store them inside variables**, **pass them as arguments to other functions** and **return them from other functions**.

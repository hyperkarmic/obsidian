# expression vs statements
#### Expressions Return a Value!!!!

An expression is a phrase that evaluates to produce a value. Look at the picture to see that `2+5` is an expression that returns the value of `7`.

**Difference between statements and expressions:**

-   **Expressions return a value**
-   **Statements are executed to make something happen but don’t return a value**

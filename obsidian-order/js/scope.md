# scope

Scope: Scope stands for variable access. So, the question is, what variable do I have access to when a code is running? However, in Javascript, you are always in the root scope by default (the window scope). These boundaries restrict variables and determine whether or not you have access to them. It restricts a variableâ€™s visibility or availability to other parts of the code

Scope:In JavaScript, we have three scopes: global scope, function scope, and block scope. Global scope is that first-level, ancestor-to-all scope. There is only one global scope in the entire script. Function scope is a scope created every time a function is created. And block scope is a scope created for conditionals and loops.

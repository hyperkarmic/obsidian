# javascript library

is a library that contains pre-written, useful JavaScript codes that anyone can use to build different parts of an application without building the code from scratch and wasting time on it.

**having a library of pre-made code is also becoming a necessity for newcomers and seasoned developers. JavaScript libraries focus on framework setup, AJAX handling, and DOM manipulation.**  Code in a JavaScript library is developed by developers for other developers in an effort to streamline and accelerate the software development process.

A library is a collection of specific tools and features that you can add to your website for functionality. Unlike a framework, a library does not offer any structure but rather implements different behaviors and actions on your webpage.

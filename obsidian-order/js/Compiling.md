“[T]he purpose of Babel is to take your code which uses new features that browsers may not support yet, and transform it into code that any browser you care about can understand.”—

# What Is Compiling JavaScript?

[Babel](https://babeljs.io/) is used to compile your code to be compatible with older versions of JavaScript (and thus work in older browsers).

Compiling means the compiler (Babel) performs syntax transforms, but it does not add any new JavaScript primitives.

When you compile your code, you are transforming it.

### **PWA and Native Apps: the Pros, Cons, and Comparisons**

Progressive apps and [native apps](https://dzone.com/articles/the-future-of-native-mobile-apps) both have their benefits and limitations. The one that is right for you meets the demands of your business and users alike. We covered essential metrics in this section.  

**Download and installations**

-   Mobile application downloads require a lot of commitment; most users are looking for quick answers and solutions to their questions and problems, respectively.
-   Progressive web apps don't require any app stored download and installation. Instead, it can be added to the users' home screen and seamlessly integrated into their system settings.

**Performance**

-   Progressive web apps load fast even with a limited or poor connection. Users are more inclined to stay on a web page if it has a fast loading speed. This makes PWA; SEO friendly. Optimal performance is crucial for business productivity.
-   On the other hand, native apps are developed to suit operating system specifications; this makes them powerful. Native apps can access device hardware perform more calculations, and deliver a better user experience.

**Features and Functionalities**

-   A native app can provide better features and functionalities than a progressive web application. The downside is installing updates to ensure the app is functioning optimally. On the other hand, an outdated mobile app means ancient features and functionality.
-    A PWA doesn't offer as many features as a native app but is always up to date, so users always enjoy an improved experience.

**Offline Availability**

-   Pre-caching allows PWA to deliver offline functionality to certain parts of the web app at a time. But if a user requests any information or feature which isn't part of the natural caching system, they won't be given access. So, for example, you could browse static pages of the app, but you couldn't interact with the web app until connectivity is restored.
-   Native apps fare far better when it comes to availability. Without an internet connection, a native app can deliver consistent information (and offline functionality).

**Cost**

-   It is expensive to build native apps since you need to develop both versions separately if you want genuinely native features. Native app development for Android uses Java, Kotlin, and objective C, swift for Apple operating system. It costs more and takes more people to manage two different development stacks. The high Cost is a risky barrier for early-stage startups who want initial traction and feedback from real users.
-   The process of creating PWAs, on the other hand, is quicker and less expensive since it is fundamentally a web app designed to work on any mobile device, irrespective of the operating system.

**Time**

-   A native app is time-consuming to build because the functionalities are specific to operating systems. For example, the native approach requires software development teams to launch Android and iOS applications. In addition, validation is needed from app stores to launch and distribute native apps.
-   Progressive web apps are faster to build and deploy because, essentially, a PWA is a website. It can be quickly developed compared to a native app; this is useful to test user experience and analyze insights and feedback. Not having to wait for app store validation is a plus.

If you're still early and want to ship quickly (or get initial traction), PWAs may be the right choice.

### Benefits of Progressive Web Applications 

**Boosts Conversions & Retention:** PWAs load faster, help find information instantly and increase time spent by the user.

**Improves Engagement**: PWAs can be designed to boost engagement through push notifications and faster load timings on mobile phones. 

**Support for Offline Usage**: PWAs can be used offline even with erratic connections (thanks to pre-caching). As a result, the website loads reliably and is never unavailable.

Essentially, a progressive web app is a website that appears and functions like a native mobile app. A progressive web app

-   Run in the browser, 
-   Doesn't need to download the app from the Google Play Store or iOS App Store. 

PWAs are meant to eliminate the problems associated with slow or unreliable networks and poor connectivity.  
PWA-compliant sites use the latest web technologies to ensure reliable, fast, and engaging experiences.

Users appreciate that PWAs do not require installation. Consequently, businesses and their customers both benefit from this.

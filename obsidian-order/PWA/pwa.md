## PWA
# What is a `PWA`?

**Progressive Web Apps** (`PWA`) are **web applications** that have been designed so they are **capable** (utilize native features), **reliable** (work even in offline mode), and **installable**. These three pillars transform them into an experience that feels like a platform-specific application.

# Why use `PWA`?

At their heart, **Progressive Web Apps** are just web applications. Using progressive enhancement, new capabilities are enabled in modern browsers. Using `service workers` and a `web app manifest`, a web application can be converted into a `PWA`. If the new capabilities aren't available, users still get the core experience.

PWA:Can also run without an active internet connection

-   Receive push notifications even when minimized
    
-   It looks like a mobile app when launched from the home screen

 PWA: a PWA is a set of good practices, which will make our application “adapt” to the user’s device. This adjustment includes, for example, push notifications, the ability to work offline, etc.

 ## **What Is a Progressive Website?**

A [progressive app](https://dzone.com/articles/the-ultimate-guide-to-progressive-web-applications) mirrors the behavior of an app but isn't an app. This technology helps improve the mobile experience. A PWA looks and feels like a mobile app but lacks all the mobile app's functionalities. They don't need to be downloaded from the app store but are placed on users' home screens.

PWA can be developed using [JavaScript frameworks](https://dzone.com/articles/javascript-frameworks-how-to-make-your-choice)- React, Vue.js, Preact, and angular. Service worker - a JavaScript code helps pre-cache resources and improves speed, functionality, push notifications, and offline access.

### **What Features or Attributes Make Up a PWA?**

-   It is responsive - can adequately adapt to screen sizes, keeping optimal functionality.
-   Mobile app look, feel, and functionality.
-   It can be used offline and online.
-   Integrations like push notifications, blue tooth, access to photos and videos, etc., to improve user experience.
-   Always up to date with the latest functionalities
-   **Discoverable**: W3C Manifest files and Service Worker registration scope make it possible for search engines to identify them as "applications."
-   **Installable**: Users can choose which apps they want to "hold" to their home screens via browser prompts, avoiding the hassles of installing an app store.
-   **Linkable**: meaning they're zero-friction, zero-install, and easy to share.

## introduction to PWA

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web apps that use new capabilities to provide a more integrated experience and can be installed as a mobile application. Since it's a web app, it can reach anyone, anywhere, on any device, all with a single codebase. Once installed, a PWA looks like any other app, such as:

-   It has an icon on the home screen, app launcher, launchpad, or start menu.
-   It appears when you search for apps on the device.
-   It opens in a standalone window, separated from a browser's user interface.
-   It has access to higher levels of integration with the OS, for example, URL handling or title bar customization.
-   It can work offline.

A Progressive Web App includes features from both worlds (web and native apps).

-   They're fast and lightweight.
-   They work offline unlike other apps.
-   They are discoverable via a search engine.

## PWA
# What is a `PWA`?

**Progressive Web Apps** (`PWA`) are **web applications** that have been designed so they are **capable** (utilize native features), **reliable** (work even in offline mode), and **installable**. These three pillars transform them into an experience that feels like a platform-specific application.

# Why use `PWA`?

At their heart, **Progressive Web Apps** are just web applications. Using progressive enhancement, new capabilities are enabled in modern browsers. Using `service workers` and a `web app manifest`, a web application can be converted into a `PWA`. If the new capabilities aren't available, users still get the core experience.

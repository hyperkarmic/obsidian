## REST core principles

REST operates on a set of core principles that guide its design and implementation. These principles include:

1.  **Stateless**: Each API request is self-contained and carries all the information needed to process it. The server should not store any information about the clientâ€™s state between requests.
2.  **Client-Server**: The client and server are separate entities that communicate over a network. The client is responsible for the user interface, while the server handles data processing and storage.
3.  **Cacheable**: Responses from the server can be cached by the client to improve performance and reduce server load.
4.  **Layered System**: RESTful architectures can be composed of multiple layers, each with its own set of responsibilities. This separation of concerns helps improve scalability and maintainability.
5.  **Uniform Interface**: RESTful APIs should have a consistent and uniform interface, making them easier to understand and use. Key constraints include using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and meaningful URLs.

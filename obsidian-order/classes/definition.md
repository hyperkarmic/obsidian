Each of these objects is then called an “instance” of the class.

_Class:__"a class in a program is a definition of a “type” of custom data structure that includes both data and behaviors that operate on that data. Classes define how such a data structure works, but classes are not themselves concrete values. To get a concrete value that you can use in the program, a class must be instantiated (with the "new" keyword) one or more times."_

_Class:_ _Classes define objects that share certain properties. Classes can be thought of as types_

Class:Class in JavaScript serves the same purpose as in any OOP language, i.e to create a blueprint for objects.

Classes Unlike the classes in Object-Oriented Mode, JavaScript classes are just special type of functions. But instead of using the "function" keyword we use the "class". It was introduced in JavaScript to make the syntax look like other object-oriented languages (java, python, c++).

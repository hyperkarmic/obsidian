## terminal search

# Easily search and use the commands that you had used in the past

If you’re using the modern bash shell, then you can use `Ctrl +R`as a keyboard shortcut to search through your command history. You can bring up commands that you used previously and issue them over again. This might work in other shells as well, such as if you’re using `ksh` in emacs mode. Using this little trick, you can actually speed up your command line workload a great deal.

1.  Type `Ctrl +R` in the terminal
2.  Enter the search term. In the below example I gave `pass`
3.  The latest command with the search keyword comes up. Hit Enter when you want to run the command

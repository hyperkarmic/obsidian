 # Egoless Coding

### In 1971, Gerald M. Weinberg introduced the world to Egoless Programming. Today, these principles are still relevant. Here is the list of these ten principles:

####  1)Understand and accept that you will make mistakes.  
The point is to find them early before they reach production. Fortunately, except for the few who develop missile guidance software, bugs rarely have fatal consequences in our industry, so we can, and should, learn, laugh, and move on.

#### 2)You are not your code.  
Remember that the goal of a review is to find problems. So don't take it personally when a mistake of yours is discovered. Software is meant to be changed or rewritten and discarded. You are not.

#### 3)No matter how much "karate" you know, someone will always know more.
That person can teach you some new moves if you ask them to. So seek and accept information from others.

#### 4)Don't rewrite code without consulting it first.  
There's a fine line between "fixing code" and "rewriting code." Know the difference. You have the code, but you don't have the whole picture. Please don't act like a punisher and talk about it first with the person involved.

#### 5)Treat those who know less than you with respect, politeness, and patience.  
Non-technical people who deal with developers frequently believe that we are at best divas and worst whiners. Don't reinforce this stereotype with anger and impatience.

#### 6)The only constant in the world is change.
Remain open to it and accept it with a smile. Look at every change to your requirements, platform, or tools as a challenge, not an inconvenience to be fought.

#### 7)The only real authority derives from knowledge, not position.  
Knowledge breeds authority, and authority breeds respect. So if you want to be respected in an egoless environment, cultivate knowledge.

#### 8)Fight for what you believe in, but accept defeat with sportsmanship. 
Understand that sometimes your ideas will be ignored. But, even if it turns out you were right, don't be vindictive or say, "I told you so."

#### 9)Don't be "that guy in the room."  
Software development is a collaborative game played by humans. Don't hide behind your screen. Play the game.

#### 10)Criticize the code and not the people.  
Software is meant to be changed or rewritten and discarded. Your colleagues are not.

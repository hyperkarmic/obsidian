Technical Debt

Technical Debt: **technical debt is the idea that building short-term solutions to technical systems incurs a set of trade-offs, resulting in future obligations that must be repaid in the form of engineering work.**
<hr>
**Technical Debt:** **n this metaphor, doing things the quick and dirty way sets us up with a technical debt, which is similar to a financial debt. Like a financial debt, the technical debt incurs interest payments, which come in the form of the extra effort that we have to do in future development** **(Martin Fowler)**

Technical Debt:**Technical debt** (also known as **design debt**[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt#cite_note-Girish_2014-1) or **code debt**, but can be also related to other technical endeavors) is a concept in [software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development) that reflects the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy (limited) solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.
<hr>

Technical Debt:**Technical debt — also known as tech debt or code debt** — _is what happens when a development team speeds up the delivery of a project or functionality that will require refactoring later on. A quicker development process becomes the priority instead of high-quality code._

Technical Debt:“Shipping first time code is like going into debt. A little debt speeds development so long as it is paid back promptly with a rewrite… The danger occurs when the debt is not repaid. Every minute spent on not-quite-right code counts as interest on that debt. Entire engineering organizations can be brought to a stand-still under the debt load of an unconsolidated implementation, object-oriented or otherwise.” — Ward Cunningham, 1992

technical debt is the accumulation of extra work generated by making bad choices or taking shortcuts. Imagine building a very high building. If you start with a weak base, the cost of properly rebuilding that base will grow as you keep building higher and higher. At some point, the cost of repair is higher than tearing it down and starting over.

Technical Debt:Technical debt will eventually cost a company a lot of money. Now that you know the term and what it is, make sure to spot technical debt in the making and warn your teammates and superiors.

_Technical debt:_ The definitions and significance of [technical debt](https://blogs.starcio.com/2020/06/5-ways-manage-technical-debt.html) vary. On the lower end, it can be a small area of code that requires refactoring, libraries that need upgrading, or unit testing that needs fixing. On the higher end, technical debt includes reengineering complex monolithic applications, porting outdated web service protocols, consolidating multiple platforms to one standard, cleansing [data debt](https://blogs.starcio.com/2020/01/big-data-debt.html) issues, modernizing infrastructure, introducing observability practices, or automating a backlog of manual test cases. The worst type of technical debt is [burning platforms](https://blogs.starcio.com/2020/11/how-to-alert-on-technical-debt-legacy.html) with recurring outages and incidents that impact the business.
<hr>
Technical Debt:My simple definition of technical debt is when technologies running in production require fixing, refactoring, modernizing, upgrading, reengineering, or replacing before or as part of implementing the strategic business requirements.

-   **Developers who don’t know what technical debt is, have no chance of not creating it.**
-   **Those who know about technical debt but don’t put in steps to prevent it will create technical debt.**
-   **The development teams who put in quality steps to stop it from being added (rules, processes, standards, code reviews) will keep most of the technical debt at bay but cannot stop it from sneaking into the code base.**

# **Technical debt is inevitable**

Technical debt is an inevitable part of multiple developers with different skill levels working on the same codebase using an agile project methodology.

A common cause is agile development. Drip feeding features/requirements results in adding extra functionality to existing code you couldn’t predict in the original design. Development teams find themselves in the tough position of adding new features that need to work with existing features, but were never designed originally to do that.

Time and deadlines create technical debt. Development teams are not given time to redesign the code, so they have to push square pegs through round holes.
***
At certain points, it needs to be rationalised to take multiple designs and make one cleaner, logical design. Like trimming away unneeded sentences and words from a document. This process brings clarity to the code and simplifies it.

Removing technical debt doesn’t have instant benefits. The benefits are long-term. This doesn’t fit in with the short-term nature of current software development that focuses only on the creation of software but not on its maintenance.

The maintenance costs are future problems that will be owned by someone else.
***
Technical debt arises when **choosing a non-ideal technical implementation over an ideal one**. The most common reason to choose this path is to save time _in the present_ because most of the time you are required to implement the ideal solution in the future anyway.

Furthermore, just like with regular debt, interest is to be paid over technical debt. This comes in many forms but comes down to **having to spend more time on changes due to imperfect implementations**.

For example, a method is duplicated because extracting it properly is considered too time-consuming. When that method later requires a change, you are required to make _two_ changes, as the code is duplicated. This extra second change is an example of interest on technical debt.

#### 4 types of tech debt
![[4debts.jpg]]
There are four main types of technical debt:

-   **Test Automation Debt**: uncovered code
-   **Defect Debt**: incorrectnesses in the working of code
-   **Documentation Debt**: lack of proper documentation
-   **Design Debt**: deviations from desired design

Interest on technical debt takes one of these four forms as well, revealing its dangerous property to grow exponentially.

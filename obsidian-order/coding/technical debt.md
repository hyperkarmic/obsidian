Technical Debt

Technical Debt: **technical debt is the idea that building short-term solutions to technical systems incurs a set of trade-offs, resulting in future obligations that must be repaid in the form of engineering work.**

**Technical Debt:** **n this metaphor, doing things the quick and dirty way sets us up with a technical debt, which is similar to a financial debt. Like a financial debt, the technical debt incurs interest payments, which come in the form of the extra effort that we have to do in future development** **(Martin Fowler)**

Technical Debt:**Technical debt** (also known as **design debt**[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt#cite_note-Girish_2014-1) or **code debt**, but can be also related to other technical endeavors) is a concept in [software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development) that reflects the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy (limited) solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.

Technical Debt:**Technical debt — also known as tech debt or code debt** — _is what happens when a development team speeds up the delivery of a project or functionality that will require refactoring later on. A quicker development process becomes the priority instead of high-quality code._

Technical Debt:“Shipping first time code is like going into debt. A little debt speeds development so long as it is paid back promptly with a rewrite… The danger occurs when the debt is not repaid. Every minute spent on not-quite-right code counts as interest on that debt. Entire engineering organizations can be brought to a stand-still under the debt load of an unconsolidated implementation, object-oriented or otherwise.” — Ward Cunningham, 1992

# refactor
## How to refactor a project?

Here are some tips:

-   Split the project into multiple modules and refactor only one part at a time.
-   Define a code specification and strictly follow it to avoid refactored code becoming shitcode again.
-   Ensure the consistency of interfaces and functions before and after refactoring.
-   Reasonable arrangement of time to ensure that it does not affect the development of business requirements.
-   Ensure unit tests cover most of the code.

# coding laws
Following SOLID design principles,

-   **Single Responsibility Principle**: A class should have only one job
-   **Open Closed Principle**: A class should be open for extension but closed for modification
-   **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of the program
-   **Interface Segregation Principle**: A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it does not use
-   **Dependency Inversion Principle**: High-level module should depend on high-level generalization, not on low-level detail

Other design principles and guidelines include,

-   **Composing Objects Principle**: Classes should achieve code reuse through aggregation rather than inheritance
-   **Law of Demeter / Principle of Least Knowledge**: Classes should know and interface with as few other classes as possible
-   **Abstraction**: Simplify by showing only relevant information
-   **Encapsulation**: Bundling attributes and behaviours into an object, and exposing features as necessary
-   **Decomposition**: Breaking an entity into parts that can be implemented separately
-   **Generalization**: Factoring out common features of classes that can be reused in other places
-   **Coupling and Cohesion**: Loosely coupled modules are less dependent and easier to reuse, while high cohesion describes a module that has a clear purpose and is not more complex than it needs to be
-   **Inheritance**: Attribute or behaviours that subclasses inherit from a superclass, or implement through an interface
-   **Information Hiding**: Modules should only have access to information that it needs to do
-   **Separation of Concerns**: Different concerns should be in different modules
-   **Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself**: Reduce repetition of code
-   **Keep It Simple Silly**: Simplicity should be a design goal
-   **Conceptual Integrity**: Create consistent software and make decisions on how the system will be designed and implemented

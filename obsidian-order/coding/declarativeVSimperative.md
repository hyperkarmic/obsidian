## Difference Between Imperative and Declarative

Before diving into their differences, it’s important to note that both imperative and declarative programming achieve the same objectives, and they’re merely two distinct approaches to coding. They both have advantages and disadvantages, and there are instances when you should employ both.

**Imperative:** This method revolves around control flow. Developers will clearly describe each step in the process and allow the computer to perform those tasks, unlike declarative programming, which specifies what a program should do.

-   The method is very flexible and adaptive
-   It briefly explains the control flow of calculation.
-   This approach leads us to write lengthy code.

**Declarative:** This is a programming paradigm in which the logic of computation is expressed without the described control flow. This means telling the machine what you would like to happen and letting the computer or program figure out how to do it. Some of the advantages are:

-   Improved code readability and comprehension
-   This method aims to explain the desired outcome without directly prescribing how to achieve it.
-   It simply represents the computational logic.
-   Less code.
-   Easier-to-track bugs.

Declarative style is essential and recommended. Because it can lead us to some real improvements on how we write code, not only in terms of writing fewer lines of code or in case of performance but by writing code at a higher level of abstraction, we can focus much more on what we want, which ultimately is all we should care about as a problem solvers.

# ACCESSABILITY
### Remember Accessibility

Accessibility is another critical quality criterion of any website. It includes website adjustments for people with special needs, disabilities and impairments that can make it difficult for them to navigate your website.

Here are a few ideas on how to [improve website accessibility](https://romeo.elsevier.com/accessibility_checklist/):

-   add alt text to all images
-   choose accessible color choices
-   enable resizable text
-   create accessible forms
-   turn off auto-play for flashing and blinking elements like ads and videos
-   provide transcripts for audio and video elements
***
## The basics are easy but we over complicate things!

I mean here is all you need to know to solve 90% of accessibility issues I see every day:

1.  Use semantic elements such as `<nav>`, `<main>` etc.
2.  Add `alt` attributes to images that describe the image in context.
3.  Add properly associated labels to forms
4.  Don't skip heading levels on a page.
5.  Don't use poor contrasting colours - use a [contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)

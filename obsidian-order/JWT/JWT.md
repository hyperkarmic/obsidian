# JWT

JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard that characterizes a conservative and independent way for safely communicating data between parties as a JSON object. This data can be checked and trusted in light of the fact that it is carefully marked. JWTs can be marked utilizing confidential (with the HMAC calculation) or a public/private key pair utilizing RSA or ECDSA.

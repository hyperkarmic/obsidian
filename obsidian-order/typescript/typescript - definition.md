It Might Look Scary

To us, the benefits of TypeScript dramatically outweigh the downsides — which do exist. Most notable to us is the additional training cost.

The most obvious solution to that problem is to phase features in slowly — you can simply enable TypeScript without changing any code, add some simple type declarations. In the end, our experience is that one can reap a lot of benefits with the most basic use of TypeScript.

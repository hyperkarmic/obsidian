Typescript:“Typescript is a strongly typed language add-on to javascript that allows compile time errors.”

It Might Look Scary

To us, the benefits of TypeScript dramatically outweigh the downsides — which do exist. Most notable to us is the additional training cost.

The most obvious solution to that problem is to phase features in slowly — you can simply enable TypeScript without changing any code, add some simple type declarations. In the end, our experience is that one can reap a lot of benefits with the most basic use of TypeScript.

# Key Differences

-   JavaScript is a scripting language that helps you create interactive web pages, whereas Typescript is a superset of JavaScript.
-   Typescript code needs to be compiled, while JavaScript code doesn’t need a compilation.
-   Typescript uses types and interfaces to describe data being used, whereas JavaScript does not.
-   Typescript has a powerful type system. Includes generics & JS features for large-size projects, whereas JavaScript is not so comfortable for larger projects.
-   The framework Angular forces you to develop in Typescript.
-   Using the framework, AngularJS enables you to use JavaScript; you can also develop in Typescript and then compile it to JavaScript.
-   React is commonly used with JavaScript, [but there are ways to use it with Typescript](https://www.sitepoint.com/react-with-typescript-best-practices/).
***
[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) provides optional static typing, classes, and interface. Large JavaScript projects can adopt Typescript to bring more robust software and an easily deployable application.

# Why Typescript?

-   Very close to C# (Microsoft invented Typescript, no surprise then)
-   TypeScript supports JS libraries & API Documentation
-   It is a superset of Javascript
-   Typed scripting language
-   TypeScript Code can be converted into plain JavaScript Code of any ECMAVersion
-   Better code structuring and object-oriented programming techniques
-   Allows better development time tool support
-   It can extend the language beyond the standard decorators, async/await
-   TypeScript supports other JS libraries
-   TypeScript is portable

# Takeaways

-   JavaScript is a dynamic language, you can reference non-existing properties and access undefined functions
-   TS is a superset of JavaScript
-   TypeScript detects errors during the coding process
-   TS lets you use the latest techniques and converts this into older valid JavaScript code
-   TypeScript brings you typed variables and interfaces
-   IntelliSense and auto-completion is implemented

Type guards in TypeScript are a way to narrow down the type of a variable or parameter within a specific block of code. They allow you to differentiate between different types and access properties or methods specific to those types, promoting type safety and reducing the likelihood of runtime errors.

## Defining Type Guards

To define a type guard, create a function that takes a variable or parameter and returns a type predicate. A type predicate is a boolean expression that narrows down the type of the parameter within the scope of the function.

```typescript
function isString(value: any): value is string {  
  return typeof value === "string";  
}
```

In this example, we define a type guard function called `isString` that checks if a given value is of type `string`. The function returns a type predicate `value is string`, which narrows down the type of the `value` parameter within the scope of the function.

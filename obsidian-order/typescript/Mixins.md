Mixins in TypeScript are a way to compose classes from multiple smaller parts, called mixin classes. They allow you to reuse and share behavior between different classes, promoting modularity and code reusability.

## Defining Mixins

To define a mixin class, create a class that extends a generic type parameter with a constructor signature. This allows the mixin class to be combined with other classes.

```typescript
class TimestampMixin<TBase extends new (...args: any[]) => any>(Base: TBase) {  
  constructor(...args: any[]) {  
    super(...args);  
  }  
  
  getTimestamp() {  
    return new Date();  
  }  
}
```

In this example, we define a mixin class called `TimestampMixin` that adds a `getTimestamp` method, which returns the current date and time. The mixin class extends a generic type parameter `TBase` with a constructor signature to allow it to be combined with other classes.
